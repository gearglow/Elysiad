# Elysiad - Idea File
## Plot Bunnies (Misc.)
### The original synopsis
Trans-humanist (not *actually* evil, just revolutionary) Voldemort pursues immortality through cybernetics; trans!Harry betrays the (reactionary, conservative, uncomprehending) Order and joins him, transitioning in the process. "Harry" becomes her deadname, fulfilling the prophecy.

### Riddle is trying to find a way to make muggles magical.
This led to researching blood and soul magics. Lily Evans-Potter was researching along similar lines, which is what led Snape and Peter to bring them together on Halloween 1981.

### V's plan
is manifold: destabilize the Ministry and build up an anarcho-communist alternative, meanwhile creating a way to make muggles magical in preparation for the failure of the Statute of Secrecy. Because right now everything sucks and it'll doom them all.

### Riddle goes by V post-resurrection
because he read V For Vendetta while with Quirrell and thought it amusing.

### The Dark Lord of the prophecy is Dumbledore, not Riddle.
#### TODO Implications?

### Given that Dumbledore is the prophecied Dark Lord
the "power the Dark Lord knows not" is computers.

### Parselmouths spellcode in Python. :-p

### Elysium was developed with uploaded magical portraits.
Riddle is the first to actually enter it.

### Hermione and Harry find the MUD interface for Elysium
in the summer of 1992 and assume it's just a game like other MUDs. Eventually many of their friends join them.

### The Grangers are active participants in events
After the first Diagon Alley trip, the Grangers do research on the magical world and what's possible, and realize that mind-control magic is uncomfortably prevalent. So they prepare contingency plans. These are fully effective by the time the first year is over.

### Hermione and the twins reverse-engineer the Fidelius charm and build a portable runestone version, which is later built into FoE's nanite power armor.

### Sprout is Dumbledore's second. She also has horcruxes, and the two have an agreement to resurrect each other.

### Elysia and V's plan
is to fake Harry defeating Voldemort, per Dumbledore's interpretation of the prophecy, at which point Voldemort fakes vis death and assumes a new identity. Elysia transitions secretly and uses the Boy-Who-Lived victory prestige to push through certain measures before also assuming her new identity (faking a fatal injury from the "duel" perhaps?). FoE then becomes a parallel group to V's Inner Circle, working to destabilize pureblood society while the Inner Circle sets up the replacement. FoE does this by, among other measures, becoming thieves, saboteurs, and assassins. Ward-breaking becomes a substantial plot point.

### Humans are 4-part holographic fractals
Body, mind, soul, and magic.

### The diary is _Dumbledore's_ horcrux, not Riddle's.
+ Dumbledore originally steals Riddle's form with polyjuice to make the diary horcrux (using a stolen diary from Riddle's room).
+ This sets Riddle up as the perfect patsy for Dumbledore's machinations.

### Dumbledore's horcruxes are the diary and Fawkes the phoenix.
+ He wanted a three-part soul, as a trade-off between sanity and power.

### Elysia's scar contains a piece of *Lily's* soul
The night of the explosion, James interrupted a soul magic ritual, and the backlash chipped off a piece of Lily's soul and embedded it in Elysia's forehead along with some of V's magical core.

### James and Sirius as aurors post-1978
They have a very Jim-Gordon-and-Harvey-Bullock dynamic.

## Magic
### The Fidelius Charm
+ Has a glaring weakness - it breaks when the secret-keeper dies (see 12 Grimmauld Place in DH canon).
+ On that note, why did it break on the Godric's Hollow cottage if Peter is still alive?

## Ships

Open triad in 3rd year.
### Tracy Davis, Daphne Greengrass, and Millie Bulstrode
Open triad in 3rd year.
### Tracy Davis and Blaise Zabini
Open relationship, late 2nd year. They co-flirt constantly.

## Culture
### Things Muggles Do Better
#### Information
 Access, Storage/Retrieval, Processing, etc.
 This has *IMPLICATIONS.*

#### Comfortable transportation
 Floo? Really?

#### Entertainment
 what, no Pok√©mon? Sad; Luna would love it. No TV or films or video games or even quidditch broadcasts, either.

#### Communication
 Availability, Speed, Security, Adaptability

### Things Wix Do Better
#### Rapid transportation
 You'll get there almost immediately, but you'll either fall on your face, lose your lunch, or both. If not worse.

#### Medicine
 Magic can heal grevious injuries, and very quickly. Legilimency can assist with mind-healing in ways muggles can't even fathom.

#### Accessibility
 Magic can be used by anywix as long as they have a wand, and can assist with many disabilities.

### Things That Are Just Different
#### Discrimination
The magical world mostly just has classism, species-ism, and blood-purism. Muggles don't have to worry about cross-species relations, or blood purity in that sense, but that just amplifies the other kinds.

## Items
### Magitech implants
in feet, shoulder blades, hands, eyes, spine, essence extractor. Eventual full magitech shell rebuild.

### Portal gates
walkthrough gateways between two points. Much less unpleasant than the floo network. Just like the barrier at Platform 9 3/4.
+ Can tap into the same network?
+ Can use own network?
+ Stargate-style?

### Hormone implant
+ maintains desired hormone levels to assist in transition.
+ probably unnecessary if the Resurrection Cask is used for rebuild.

### CommUne
Communication Unit. Brain implant that allows wireless communication and sense/emotion/memory sharing, as well as a firewall for legilimency. Can be integrated with other brain implants, such as memory and cognition aids.

### Power armor implant
+ a la Iron Man Extremis or Samus


## Locations
### Riddle Manor
is being retrofitted into a proper technomagic R&D complex. There's a Cray in the basement.

## Dialogue
+ "The prophecy is fulfilled. Harry Potter is no more."
+ "The follies of my youth seem to plague me even now. Zealots may make for convenient troops, but they're more trouble than they're worth and near impossible to reign in."
+ "Well, one good thing came out of that Halloween. The whole war was a giant Gordian Knot situation. I guess that makes you the sword."
+ "'It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.' Well, Mr. Greater Good should take his own advice. Some peoples' dreams are other peoples' nightmares."
+ "Burn it all down. And then what? What does rebuilding look like?"
+ "Boy, girl, whatever, I'm still hotter than you," Draco smirked.
+ "I'm sorry for thinking you were a spy, Moony. Can you forgive me?" "That's OK, Padfoot. I was a spy, actually. You purebloods have some pretty big blind spots when it comes to how the rest of us are treated, you know."
+ "Our wands aren't the only brothers here." "I'm a girl, actually." "Siblings, then. I'm not exactly male either."
+ "It's Luna and the Twins! Yes, Luna and the Twins! They terrorize the teachers, except Professor Binns! They're all completely nuts! They kick Death Eater butt! They're Luna, Luna and the Twins Twins Twins Twins Twins! (doodle-de-doom-doom...)"

## Scenes
### Halloween Night, 1981
### Intersperse normal chapters with IC field reports.
### Prelude
He wore the label of "boy" like he wore Dudley's hand-me-downs. Neither fit, but what choice was there?
### Fred and George prank Snape
so that "to" and "from" are swapped when he speaks.
### Elysia meets a unicorn in CoMC class.
Pre-transition?
### Harry uses V's Resurrection Cask
to transition over the summer of 1995. V and Elysia decide to let people think Voldemort had killed Harry Potter, and Elysia Evans joins Hogwarts as a transfer student. This gets her out from under Dumbledore's thumb and away from the Dursleys, and lets Elysia get on with her life. It also demoralizes the Order.
