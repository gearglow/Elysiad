# Year 1 - Ch. 2 - Diagon and Draco
The next day, July 31st, dawned as clear and bright as the day before had been stormy. After a breakfast of sausages, which Hagrid had pulled from yet another pocket of his coat, he and Harry made their way back to shore.

Hagrid led the way through London until they reached a dingy little pub that all the pedestrians seemed to ignore. The sign above the door read The Leaky Cauldron. When they entered, however, it was clean, well-lit, and well-populated. The barman nodded at Hagrid as they entered. "The usual, Hagrid?"

"Not today, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business. Ecsortin' young Harry Potter 'ere to get his school things."

Tom peered over the bar. "Harry Potter? *The* Harry Potter?"

Harry found himself quickly mobbed by the pub's patrons, all insisting on shaking his hand. Among them was a nervous-looking man wearing a purple turban, whom Hagrid greeted as "Professor Quirrell."

"Harry, this 'ere is Professor Quirrell," Hagrid said, patting the professor on the back and nearly knocking him flat. "He teaches at Hogwarts."

"What do you teach?" Harry asked as he helped the man to his feet.

"D-d-defense Against the D-d-dark Arts," Quirrell replied, as if he'd rather not think about it, and promptly excused himself.

Hagrid dispersed the rest of the crowd and dragged Harry through the back door into an alley, with trash bins and a brick wall the only things in sight.

"Um, Hagrid, what-" Harry started to say, when Hagrid whipped out his pink umbrella and started counting bricks.

"I allus forget which it is," he muttered. "Ah! Found it." He tapped a brick with his umbrella and the whole wall began to roll back on itself, finally leaving an arch through which Harry could see a very busy street.

"Welcome to Diagon Alley," Hagrid said with a flourish as they stepped through.

It was much brighter in the Alley, and much louder. Harry followed closely behind Hagrid as he strode off purposefully down the street.

"Stick close, Harry, there's a lad," Hagrid boomed. "Gringotts first. That's the wizarding bank," he continued, grabbing Harry by the hand as they pushed past a crowd around a shop with a sign saying Quality Quidditch Supplies. Whatever 'quidditch' was. "Run by goblins, it is."

Harry could believe it. Diagon Alley seemed a strange and wonderful place; everywhere he looked there was something unexpected.

Eventually they reached an imposing white marble building, with large bronze doors at the top of a broad flight of stairs. Two figures in gold armour held large spears on either side.

"Ah, 'ere we are," Hagrid said, leading the way up the stairs. "Safest place in the world, except for Hogwarts."

They passed through the bronze doors and then a set of silver doors, which bore an inscription:

> Enter, stranger, but take heed
> Of what awaits the sin of greed
> For those who take, but do not earn,
> Must pay most dearly in their turn.
> So if you seek beneath our floors
> A treasure that was never yours,
> Thief, you have been warned, beware
> Of finding more than treasure there.

Harry shuddered a bit at that; it sounded ominous.

Hagrid led the way across a large, opulent marble-floored room to the nearest available teller, a grumpy-looking goblin squinting at a pile of rubies on a brass scale. At Hagrid's approach, he looked up. "Can I help you?" He sneered.

"Got a couple o' vaults to visit. 687 and 713."

"Your keys?" The goblin asked unctuously.

"Just a sec." Hagrid rummaged around in his pockets and placed two keys on the counter.

The goblin peered closely at them, then pulled out a scroll and scanned it for a moment.

"Very well. Griphook!" The goblin snapped his fingers, and another goblin approached. "Griphook here will take you to your vaults. Next!"

With that, Harry and Hagrid followed Griphook to another room, this one rough-hewn and looking more like a cave. There was a mine cart on tracks, which Griphook waved them into before joining them. He pulled a lever, and the cart set off down the track at a break-neck pace. Harry thought it was very like a roller-coaster, or at least what he thought they'd be like. He started to ask Hagrid about it, but Hagrid was looking rather green and queasy, so he stayed silent.

"Vault 687, Potter Trust Vault" Griphook called as the cart finally slowed in front of a large wooden door. Hagrid staggered off and leaned one hand against the wall. Griphook stroked the centre of the door, causing a keyhole to appear. He inserted one of the keys and turned it, and the door swung open to reveal a room absolutely filled with coins. Most of them were gold, but here and there were some of silver or copper.

Hagrid passed him a rather large bag (though it looked like a belt pouch in his enormous hand) and explained about the currency, which made Harry's head hurt. "You'll get used ter it," Hagrid commented. "Jes' grab a bunch o' the gold ones."

Harry did so, stuffing the bag almost too full to close. It never seemed to get any heavier, though. "Can we convert some to pounds?" He asked Griphook.

"You'll have to ask a teller," the goblin replied shortly. "5 pounds to a galleon. Plus fees, of course," he added with a toothy smile.

Harry just nodded. He'd never even seen 5 pounds, except on TV when the Dursleys watched during meals. He'd never had any money of his own at all, and was feeling rather overwhelmed.

Hagrid guided him back to the cart, following Griphook. As they all got back in the cart, the door closed with a muffled boom and the keyhole vanished. The cart took off again, deeper into the caves. Finally the cart slowed again, and stopped in front of another door.

"Vault 713," Griphook called. Hagrid stumbled to the door, where the goblin again stroked the door and inserted the key. Harry peered through excitedly, curious as to what fantastic treasures could be sequestered here after the last vault. But there was nothing in this one except a small, grubby package, about 4 inches long, wrapped in plain brown paper and tied with twine. Hagrid scooped it up and sequestered it away in his hairy coat of many pockets, then staggered back to the cart.

They rode the cart back up, and Harry followed Hagrid to a bench in the main room. "Go on and get yer pounds, Harry," he panted, "I'll wait 'ere and catch me breath."

So Harry went back to the teller, exchanging a small mountain of gold coins for a not-much-smaller stack of bills, then he and Hagrid left the bank.

"What now?" Harry asked as they stood at the foot of the marble stairs, blinking in the sunlight after the dim caverns.

"Firs' we ought ta get yer trunk; we can put the res' o' yer' supplies in it. Easier ter carry, see," Hagrid replied. He led the way down the alley, to a shop called Packard's Luggage. The inside of the shop was full of trunks and bags and such. A rotund man appeared, with round glasses, twinkling eyes, and a wreath of curly white hair ringing his otherwise-bald head.

"Good day to you, gentlemen! What can I do for you?" He asked jovially, shaking them both by the hand. Harry nearly dropped his sack of galleons.

"I'm going to Hogwarts," Harry replied hesitantly.

"Ah," the man said kindly, "first time away from home? Well, the standard package is a canvas book-bag and this trunk here." He lightly kicked an oak trunk with cast-iron fittings. "No enhancements standard, but if you see a style you like we can always add some."

"Enhancements?" Harry asked.

"Oh, you know. Featherweight, bottomless, durability, extra compartments, that sort of thing. Oh, and security features, too. Slytherins are quite fussy about those." He winked at Harry.

Harry looked at Hagrid in confusion. What was a Slytherin? Hagrid just smiled down and said, "Take a look around, Harry. See anythin' that strikes yer fancy?"

Determined to have something nice for once, Harry found a black leather satchel with striated gunmetal-grey filigree fittings; it reminded him of something out of the Lord of the Rings books he'd found in his primary school's library. A trunk then caught his eye; it was a rich chocolate brown with matching fittings. "These," he said, looking back to Hagrid and the shopkeeper.

"You have a good eye, lad," the shopkeeper smiled. "These are from our Merlin line. That satchel is dragon-hide, with a mokeskin lining, and the fittings on both it and that walnut trunk are a rare alloy only used by a few craftsmen. It's called Damascus Steel. Now," he gestured to the items, "those come with top-of-the-line enchantments already, for durability, featherweight, undetectable extension, and easy retrieval. The trunk itself has several compartments, as well, including a bookshelf, 30' x 30' room with air refreshing charm, and wardrobe. There are also runes for self-shrinking and self-sorting, though that takes some training up before it learns your sorting methods. Oh, and a full suite of security wards, of course."

"How much?" Harry asked with wide eyes, not daring to hope he could afford such things.

"Only 250 galleons, for both. The trunk alone is 150, and the satchel is 110, but I'll give you 10 galleons off for both."

Harry's eyes widened, and he peered into his sack of galleons. "D'you think there's enough in here?" He asked, "or will I have to go back to Gringotts?"

"Here, I'll help you count," the shopkeeper said, waving his wand. A cloud of galleons flew from the sack and began stacking themselves neatly atop the trunk. After a bit, there were 25 stacks of 10, and the sack was noticeably less full, though not empty by any stretch. Harry sighed with relief before grinning at the shopkeeper.

"I'll take them!"

The shopkeeper waved his wand again, and the stacks of galleons flew off behind the counter at the back of the shop. He showed Harry how to use each function on his new purchases, and then an excited Harry followed Hagrid out of the shop, satchel on his shoulder and trunk in his satchel.

"This is amazing, Hagrid!" Harry gushed as he put the galleon sack in his satchel, "I've never had anything new before, or this nice! And it's so useful! D'you think I can fit that cauldron in my bag, or should we put it in the trunk instead? I bet you could even fit in one of these pockets!" He laughed.

He stopped suddenly, eyes widening. "I can't wear this! I look ridiculous! A nice satchel like this and Dudley's hand-me-downs. I look like I stole this bag!"

Hagrid chuckled. "A good thing we're off ter Madam Malkin, then. She'll see yer sorted right quick, ye'll see." He led the way to another shop, one with mannequins dressed in robes displayed in the window.

"It's a bit crowded in there fer me," Hagrid said. "Go on, I'll wait out 'ere."

A bell tinkled over the door as Harry entered. The shop was brightly-lit and crowded with racks upon racks of robes in every colour and style.

"Hogwarts, dear?" A voice came from the back of the shop. Harry looked up, and a witch bustled over. "I've got another one just in as well."

Harry nodded. "Yes, please. And something for when I'm not in school too," he added, gesturing down at his attire. "I've had enough of this."

Madam Malkin sniffed, noticing Harry's attire for the first time. "Yes, I should say so. Come on, then, to the back and we'll get you sorted."

Harry followed her to the back of the shop and stepped up on a pedestal. "Off with those while I get a start on young Malfoy here," she said.

"Malfoy," it turned out, was a disconcertingly pretty person with a head of shoulder-length blond hair, pale skin, piercing grey eyes, and a perpetual smirk. Harry fought back a blush as he stripped off Dudley's hand-me-downs.

"Hogwarts too?" Malfoy drawled, shifting about atop his pedestal. He was in an oversized robe, and a tailor's tape made its measurements as an assistant pinned the robe to size.

"Yes," Harry said, as Madam Malkin dropped a much-too-large robe over his head and a tape began taking his own measurements.

"My mother and father are next door buying my books," Malfoy said, sounding bored. "Then I'm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll convince Father to get me one anyway and I'll smuggle it in somehow."

Harry didn't quite know what to make of this. On the one hand, he was reminded rather strongly of Dudley. On the other, there was a hint of a smile when the boy had said that last part; he thought maybe Malfoy was taking the mickey.

"Have you got your own broom?" Malfoy continued.

"No," said Harry.

"Play quidditch at all?"

"No," Harry said again. This was the second time he'd heard the word, and he still had no idea what 'quidditch' was.

"I do - Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my House team, and I must say, I agree." Malfoy raised his eyebrows. "Do you know what House you'll be in yet?"

"No," said Harry, feeling more lost by the minute.

"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I'll likely be in Slytherin, all our family have been. Imagine being in Hufflepuff; I think Father would have a fit."

"Mmm," said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.

"I say, look at that man!" Malfoy exclaimed suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams in his hand.

"That's Hagrid," Harry responded, pleased to finally be able to contribute to the conversation. "He works at Hogwarts."

"Oh," Malfoy said, "I've heard of him. He's a sort of servant, isn't he?"

"He's the gamekeeper," said Harry.

"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of *savage* - lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed."

"I think he's brilliant," said Harry coldly.

"Do you?" Malfoy said, wrinkling his nose. "Well, I'm only relaying what I'd heard, anyway. It's not as if I've met him, after all. Why is he with you, anyway? Where are your parents?"

"They're dead," Harry said shortly. He didn't feel like going into it much, especially since he had yet to get the full story out of Hagrid - or anyone, for that matter.

"Oh, sorry," Malfoy said, his tone indecipherable. "But they were our kind, weren't they?"

"They were a witch and a wizard, if that's what you mean."

"I really don't think they should just let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. Not like the old wizarding families. What's your name, anyway?"

But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That's you done, my dear," and led him to the front of the shop.

"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," Malfoy called. Harry just nodded.

Harry picked out some new boots as well, of black dragon-hide in a chukka style, before paying for his clothes at the front. He then excused himself to the restroom to change into one of the new robes. Enjoying his new clothes, he made his way outside and found Hagrid waiting for him. They sat down on a nearby bench to eat the ice cream Hagrid had gotten them, and Harry decided it was time for some answers.

"Hagrid, can you tell me what happened to my parents?"
