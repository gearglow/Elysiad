# Year 1 - Chapter 5 - Get Sorted

The four of them returned to the compartment, where Hedwig hooted at them before returning to her nap. Ron chattered at them about quidditch, with occasional interjections from Neville. Harry thought it sounded exciting. Hermione thought it sounded more nerve-wracking than anything.

Around lunch time, there was a knock on their compartment door. Harry opened it to find a witch with a cart laden with food. "Anything from the cart, dearies?" She asked.

Ron hung back, muttering something about his mother packing sandwiches, but the rest of them trooped out to have a look. The cart contained such oddities as Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Sugar Quills, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Neville got a handful of pumpkin pasties and cauldron cakes, and a large pile of chocolate frogs. Harry and Hermione both got some of everything.

Re-entering the compartment, they dumped their purchases on the seats. Ron had pulled out a wrapped package containing four corned-beef sandwiches. "She always forgets I don't like corned-beef," he muttered.

"Why don't we share everything around?" Neville suggested. "Ron, you too. I'm quite fond of corned-beef, as it happens. Here, have a Chocolate Frog."

Ron smiled gratefully at him and accepted a frog, passing a sandwich to each of the others.

<quote-ish>
“What are these, anyway?” Harry asked Neville, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.

“No,” said Ron instead. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”

“What?”

“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”

Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.

“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.

“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”

Harry turned over his card and read:

> ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
> CURRENTLY  HEADMASTER  OF  HOGWARTS
> Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.

Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.

“He’s gone!”

“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron. “He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana Le Fey again and I’ve got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.”

“You know," said Hermione, "in the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.”

“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed. “Weird!”

Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.

“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned them. “When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a bogie-flavoured one once.”

Neville picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.
“Bleaaargh — see? Alfalfa.”

They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper.
</quote-ish>

"You're a braver man than I, Harry," Neville commented as he popped it into his mouth. "Gryffindor for sure."

Harry swallowed the pepper bean, feeling his stomach squirm. He wasn't sure, but it felt like more than just the bean making it squirm.

"Which houses do you all think you'll be in?" Neville continued.

"Gryffindor, most likely," Ron replied. "All my family's been there for ages."

"Gryffindor does sound nice," Hermione said. "Though I expect I'll be in Ravenclaw. Did you know their common room has its own library?"

Harry smiled at that. "That sounds perfect for you then. Neville, what about you?"

Neville shrugged and smiled shyly. "Hufflepuff, I expect. Not that I particularly *want* to be, mind you; all my family's been Gryffindor and Gran expects me to be, too. But I don't feel all that brave, or clever, or ambitious, so..."

"What about you, Harry?" Hermione asked. "Are you going to join me in Ravenclaw?"

Harry thought for a second. "I don't know, honestly. Hagrid says both my parents were in Gryffindor, but I wasn't exactly raised by them." He furrowed his brow at that. "I'm a hard worker, I suppose, but not by choice. And I suppose I like to learn, but I don't think I'm particularly clever. Resourceful, maybe."

"Sounds like you could be a Slytherin, then," Hermione said.

Ron shuddered. "Ugh, you don't want to be stuck with those snakes! There hasn't been a dark wizard who *hasn't* come out of Slytherin, and they're all supporters of You-Know-Who. I bet *Malfoy* ends up in Slytherin."

Harry rolled his eyes and Hermione let out an un-lady-like snort. "Not all Slytherins end up as dark wizards, Ron. The logic doesn't follow. Merlin was a Slytherin, after all."

"And Draco's not so bad," Harry mused. "I think he was just taking the mickey earlier, Ron. You say your dad and his don't get along? He probably knows how to push your buttons, then. He *did* help us find Neville's toad, after all."

Ron huffed, but looked thoughtful. "Well, still. *I* wouldn't want to be stuck in the same dorm as him."

"Maybe I'll end up a Gryffindor, then," Harry said. "My parents did, after all, and it does seem to run in families. I suppose we'll find out."

The rest of the ride was spent with Ron and Neville teaching Harry and Hermione how to play Exploding Snap, a popular wizarding card game where you had to tap identical pairs of cards with your wand before they exploded. Hermione was quite frazzled after a few games and returned to her book, but Harry continued playing with the others until an announcement echoed through the train:

"The Hogwarts Express will be arriving at Hogsmeade Station in approximately ten minutes. Please leave all luggage aboard; it will be delivered to the castle separately."

They packed up the cards, and Hermione stuffed her book into a pocket on her robes. Harry was surprised it fit, but supposed that magic was involved somewhere. Knowing Hermione, she probably had magically expanded pockets added to all her robes for exactly this purpose.

Exiting the train, Harry saw Hagrid towering over the crowd. "Firs' Years this way!" He called. "Alright there, Harry, Hermione?"

"Hullo, Hagrid," Harry responded. "These are Neville and Ron."

"A pleasure," Hagrid smiled. "Firs' Years this way! Everyone here? Alright, follow me." He set off down a trail, holding a lantern aloft in the deepening twilight. Harry and his friends followed along, shortly joined by Draco and the rest of his compartment. They trailed along like goslings behind a very large goose, and Hermione giggled when Harry muttered this to her.

"Look sharp, now," Hagrid called out. "Ye'll be seein' yer first view o' Hogwarts in a moment."

They rounded a bend in the path and stopped short. Across a lake, black and sparkling under the stars, was an enormous castle. Every window was glowing warmly, and it was so breathtaking that Harry actually teared up at the sight. *Magic is real and I get to live in a castle!* He thought, smiling. Beside him, Hermione squealed. They looked at each other, matching grins on their faces, as Hagrid gathered them all at the shore of the lake.

There were a fleet of small boats on the shore, all moored at a passel of wooden docks lit with hooded lanterns. "No more'n four to a boat," Hagrid boomed.

Harry clambered into a boat with Hermione, Ron, and Neville, and the boats began to glide smoothly across the lake, leaving only the smallest of ripples in their wake. Harry lost himself staring around in wonder until the boats neared a cliff at the far shore.

"Heads down," Hagrid instructed, and they all ducked as the boats passed through an ivy-curtained passage and into a large cavern with another passel of docks. They all clambered out as the boats moored themselves. Hagrid was checking the boats as the students clustered near a set of stairs carved in the rock. "Oy, whose toad is this?" He called out.

"Trevor!" Neville cried happily, as Hagrid handed the toad over. Neville slipped him into his pocket and they all trooped up the stairs and across the grounds behind Hagrid.

Finally, they reached the castle and an enormous set of oak doors. Hagrid marched up to them and pounded on them with an echoing *boom*, and they opened to reveal a familiar stern-looking witch in emerald robes.

"The First Years, Professor McGonagall," Hagrid announced.

"Thank you, Hagrid," Professor McGonagall said. "I shall take them from here." She led them all into a grand entrance hall, with a high ceiling and an enormous swept staircase, and gigantic oaken doors behind which a vast murmuring could be heard. Bypassing these, they all trooped into a small antechamber, where McGonagall explained what was about to happen.

"In a moment, you will all be sorted into your Houses," she announced. "These will be like your family while you are here at Hogwarts - you will take meals with your House, sleep and socialize in your House dormitories, and earn House points for good behaviour. At the end of each year, the House with the most points wins the House Cup."

Harry thought this sounded like a bribe, sort of like when Aunt Petunia gave Dudley gifts to stop him throwing tantrums.

"I will be back shortly," Prof. McGonagall continued. "In the meantime, I suggest you take a moment to make yourselves presentable." This last was said with a pointed look at Ron, who still had a spot on his nose, and Neville, whose cloak was buttoned beneath his left ear.

Harry attempted to flatten his hair down, before giving it up as a lost cause when a chorus of shrieks and yelps erupted. Turning, he saw a cluster of translucent figures floating through the wall. They were talking animatedly.

"I don't see why this nonsense is still tolerated," one said with a grimace. "He isn't even a proper ghost!"

"Well I - oh! What have we here?" Another replied, noticing the First Years huddled together. "Fresh meat!"

A few children let out whimpers as the ghost grinned at them.

The door burst open and Prof. McGonagall reentered, glaring at the ghosts. "Off with you!" She commanded.

The ghosts left the way they'd come, and Prof. McGonagall chivvied the children into line. Harry was in front of Hermione, who was muttering spells under her breath as if she were about to sit an exam, and behind Neville, who was shaking. They all trooped out of the antechamber and through the enormous double doors into the Great Hall.

The Great Hall, as its name suggested, was enormous. Cavernous, even. It was lit by thousands of candles floating above four long tables, and the ceiling glittered with countless pinpricks of light.

"It's enchanted to show the sky outside," Hermione whispered. "I do wish *Hogwarts, A History* mentioned *how*. I should like one for my bedroom."

Harry grinned and nodded, but didn't turn around as they filed past the four student tables and up to the head table on a raised dais at the far end of the room. In front of the table, still on the dais, stood a wooden four-legged stool, and resting atop this was a pointed wizard's hat, with a wide brim and more patches than original material.

As the last students lined up across the dias, a seam opened just above the hat's brim, and it began to sing.

 -[ ] TODO Insert Sorting Hat's song here

The hat subsided, and Prof. McGonagall stepped forward with a scroll. "When I call your name, sit on the stool and place the hat upon your head. Once you are sorted, please remove the hat and take a seat at your House table." Unfurling the scroll, she continued. "Abbot, Hannah!"

A blonde girl in pig-tails stepped forward to sit upon the stool. The hat came down past her eyes, and after a few seconds it yelled out, "Hufflepuff!" Hannah removed the hat and moved to sit with her House, who were all applauding enthusiastically.

"That's not so bad," Ron muttered. "I'll kill Fred and George, they were going on and on about having to wrestle a troll."

Hermione sniggered.

The numbers at the House tables swelled, as the remaining students were all sorted. Hermione sat upon the stool for nearly five minutes before the hat placed her in Slytherin. She took a seat at the Slytherin table amidst a flurry of whispering.

Neville also sat under the hat for nearly five minutes, and when it yelled out, "Gryffindor," he was so nervous that he was halfway to the table before he remembered he was still holding the hat. Grinning sheepishly, he took his seat across from the Weasley twins, to good-natured laughter and pats on the back.

Draco barely placed the hat upon his head before it shouted "Slytherin!" He took a seat across from Hermione, giving her a nod.

Pansy Parkinson, the girl from Draco's compartment, also went to Slytherin, and a pair of twin girls, Padma and Parvati Patil, went to Ravenclaw and Gryffindor respectively. And then it was Harry's turn.

"Potter, Harry!" Prof. McGonagall called, and the crowd erupted in whispers as Harry lowered the hat over his eyes.

*Well, this is interesting,* a voice said in Harry's head. *Plenty of courage, no aversion to hard work, and a clever mind as well. And ambition aplenty! And a few secrets even you haven't uncovered yet."

Harry started to ask about this last, but the hat continued over him. "You could do well in any of the Houses, but where to put you?*

*You're asking me?* Harry replied. *I thought that was* your *job!*

*Well.* The hat sniffed. *That settles that, then. Better be* "Slytherin!"

Harry swept the hat off his head to absolute silence. He opened his eyes to utter stillness. He stood to the slow stirring of confused whispers. But as he began to make his way toward the Slytherin table, the applause began. First from Hermione, then picked up by Draco, who glared at the other Slytherins until they began to applaud too. Then Neville joined in, and the Weasley twins, who were grinning like Harry had just played the best joke in the world. Harry shot them a smile as he took his seat next to Hermione. The rest of the students were still, with either shock, confusion, or both.

"Why is everyone so confused that I'm in Slytherin?" Harry asked Draco, as Prof. McGonagall cleared her throat and the Sorting continued.

"Probably because they assumed you'd be a Gryffindor like your parents," Draco replied. "Daft, really. Not to be insensitive, but it isn't as if you'd been raised by them. Why would your priorities be the same as theirs?"

Harry nodded. "That explains a lot. I bet most people believe those ridiculous storybooks about me, too."

Hermione giggled.

"You'll find, Potter," Draco said, "that some wizards are better than others. I can help you there." He offered his hand.

Harry shook it. "Thanks, Malfoy. And call me Harry."

"Only if you call me Draco."

Hermione cleared her throat, causing the two of them to jump and blush. "You're not one of those anti-muggleborn types, are you?"

Draco looked affronted. "Certainly not! A wix is a wix. Purebloods are just native to magical society, whereas muggleborns have to adjust to a new culture. It's like moving to New York - the language is the same, in theory, but sometimes words don't mean the same thing and everybody behaves differently."

Hermione nodded. "That sums it up nicely, from what I've seen so far."

"What's a wix?" Harry asked.

"It's slang. It means 'witch or wizard,'" Draco answered. "The plural is 'wixen.' I got into the habit of using it because it annoys Pansy."

Pansy herself glared at Draco from a few seats over. He smirked at her.

They all turned back to the Sorting as "Weasley, Ronald!" was called. He stayed under longer than any of the other students, nearly 7 minutes, before the Hat yelled out, "Slytherin!"

"Why does that keep happening!?" Ron moaned, red-faced, as he stomped over to the Slytherin table amidst cat-calls from Fred and George, and dropped down on Harry's other side.

"Zabini, Blaise," also went to Slytherin, and Dumbledore stood before anyone could respond to Ron's outburst.

"To all our new students, welcome to Hogwarts! To all our returning students, welcome back! I have a few words to say to you all, but as I am sure you are all ravenous, that can wait. For now, I shall limit myself to these: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!"

Dumbledore resumed his seat, and mountains of food suddenly appeared on the tables. Ron forgot his aggravation and began heaping servings of everything upon his plate. The others soon followed suit, though with considerably more decorum.

"Honestly," Hermione huffed. "Could you please chew with your mouth closed, Ronald?"

"Fowwy," Ron mumbled around a mouthful of bangers.

Draco caught Harry's eye and rolled his own. Harry giggled.

Dinner was followed by dessert, as the bangers and such were replaced by treacle tarts, pies, puddings, and biscuits of every kind.

Pleasantly full from dinner, and nibbling on a chocolate biscuit, Harry took the opportunity to observe the staff table. Headmaster Dumbledore was at the center of the table, seated on a large, throne-like chair. He had a curious look on his face, something between disgruntled and worried, and was talking in hushed tones to Professor McGonagall on his left, occasionally shooting glances Harry's way. To her left, a dour, sallow-skinned man with a large, hooked nose, stringy black hair, and black robes was talking to a nervous-looking man wearing a purple turban. Harry recognized him as Professor Quirrell, from when Hagrid had taken him to Diagon Alley on his birthday. Their eyes met and a throb of pain lanced through Harry's scar. Prof. Quirrell winced and turned away. Harry quickly followed suit.

On the right-hand end of the table was the only other person Harry recognized - Hagrid. He was chatting enthusiastically to a very short professor who was perched atop a pile of cushions stacked precariously on his chair.

Harry's observations were interrupted by Hermione asking Ron, "So what did you mean by 'that' earlier? What keeps happening?"

Ron started to reply with his mouth full, but swallowed first at a glare from Hermione. "This!" He exclaimed finally, gesturing around him at the Slytherin table. "First Hermione, a muggle-born, ends up in Slytherin, which is practically unheard-of, and then you, Harry, the Boy-Who-Lived himself!" He stabbed his fork viciously into his slice of pie. "And now me," he continued morosely. "I was supposed to be in Gryffindor, like the rest of my family." He yanked his fork back out of the pie and pushed it around his plate, slumping as he muttered. "I'll never hear the end of it."

Hermione rolled her eyes. "Well, it does have a certain poetic irony," she said. "Maybe now you'll see that not every Slytherin is evil."

"Then why are they all glaring at us?" Ron asked glumly.

Harry looked around at the rest of the table. Ron was right; there were a lot of surreptitious glances their way, and not very many of them looked friendly. Pansy was scowling openly. The others in their year, at least, were ignoring them, aside from Draco of course. But some of those upperclassmen looked *scary.*

Draco noticed Harry's trepidation and smirked. "You'll be fine. We're friends now, and my father's on the Board of Governors. Not to mention my godfather is Slytherin's Head of House. Nobody would *dare* get caught doing anything too horrible."

"It's the 'getting caught' part I'm worried about," Harry retorted.

Draco merely grinned.
