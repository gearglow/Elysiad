## Hogwarts, September 2, 1977
### The Marauders' 7th year

"Snape! Oy, Snape!"

Severus whirled in the middle of the potions corridor, groaning mentally. "Pettigrew." Because of course it was one of the Marauders, his eternal nemeses, perpetual tormenters. He'd hoped, after the events of last spring under the Whomping Willow, that they'd back off and keep the grudging armistice they'd all agreed to (under duress) in the Headmaster's office. "Where are your miscreant friends?"

Peter shrugged. "Off pining somewhere, probably. Don't really care, to be honest. Listen," He paused, a look of uncertainty crossing his face. "I- I know I've been a right berk to you all these years, and I just wanted to apologize. The others told me what happened last year" - he gesticulated vaguely - "and it got me thinking. You nearly *died* because of this - this *feud,* and that's just *wrong.* We're *children,* for Merlin's sake! How did it get so bad?"

He heaved a sigh. "Remus is furious with Sirius, you know. I think he wanted to talk to you too, to apologize, but he's worried that his, er, *furry little problem* would put you off. It kind of does a number on his self-esteem." He jammed his hands in the pockets of his robes and shuffled his feet awkwardly.

Severus' eyebrows rose. *What the fuck? An* apology? *Was the world ending?* "I- " It came out as a squawk. He cleared his throat and tried again. "I must be dreaming. Did a *Marauder* just *apologize?* To *me?*"

Peter just nodded, staring him in the eye. Severus' legilimency skills were fledgling, but even so the honest remorse in Peter's eyes was unmistakable. "We were horrible to you. I mean, you weren't exactly all sunshine and roses yourself, but I can admit that we started it in the beginning."

"James started it," Severus found himself replying. "It was loathe at first sight."

Peter snorted and rolled his eyes. "Fair. Sirius too. That first night in the dorms they wouldn't shut up about you and Evans. Sirius kept ranting about how you were everything he hated about his family, only you'd *chosen* it, and James kept mooning over Evans and wondering - whining, really - what she saw in you. Had this absurd idea of winning her away from you or some such nonsense."

Severus crossed his arms. "I didn't choose it. I was raised to it just like any pureblood by my *dear departed mother.*" A scowl marred his face and he spat. "And then *Potter* ends up in *Gryffindor* and I couldn't stand the thought of seven years in close quarters with that - that *insufferable* duo, so when the hat offered me the choice, I chose what I thought was a sanctuary."

"Only that just confirmed to them every flaw they imagined for you," Peter replied. "Didn't help that you started palling around with the likes of Rosier and Malfoy."

"Again, not really a choice," Severus grumbled. "Slytherin House has certain *expectations.* I made myself useful, they offered me protection."

Peter nodded. "Would you rather have been sorted elsewhere? Do you regret not choosing Gryffindor?"

Severus thought for a moment, surprised that he was having a civil conversation with a Marauder, of all people, about things he'd kept buried for so long. "Sometimes. They're not all Death Eaters in Slytherin, you know. But we are obliged to present a united front to the rest of the school. And that" - *lost me my only friend* - "has its price."

"I can understand that," Peter said. "The Marauders have that kind of pressure too - all for one and one for all, that sort of thing. It's just," He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly. "I'd never had friends before I met them. I didn't want to lose them. I think it was the same for the others, too; we were all rather lonely kids."

"So you decided to inflict that loneliness on someone else by driving their only friend away? Is that it?" Severus growled. "Because *that* is the real reason for this *feud,* as you put it."

Peter's eyes widened. "Oh, *fuck!* Snape, I am *so, so* sorry! And now Evans won't even talk to you!" He paused a moment, in thought. "I - I know this probably doesn't make up for any of it, but maybe - maybe we could be friends? Wipe the slate clean, start over fresh, you know."

Severus' jaw dropped. *The world really must be ending,* he thought, head spinning. "Why me?" He demanded. "Why now? Guilty conscience pricking you, Pettigrew?"

Peter shrugged. "If you want to put it like that, yeah. Only, I've been doing a lot of thinking, like I said, and maybe if we hadn't been such prats to each other from the beginning, maybe we could've been friends. Besides," he added with a smirk, "imagine the look on James and Sirius' faces when they see us having a civil conversation."

Severus couldn't help the snort that escaped. "I imagine it to be much like my own, though with their more *effusive* expressions."

Peter actually *giggled.* "There's a word for it. *I* imagine St. Mungos will be called to reattach their jaws. So how about it?" He stuck out his hand.

Severus stared at it for a long second, deliberating, before shaking it. "Don't make me regret this, Pettigrew."

Peter smiled. "I don't plan to. And call me Peter, or Pete. We're friends now, after all."

"Call me Severus, then. Or Sev, I suppose, if you must." He replied, smiling back awkwardly. *Merlin this is weird.*

Peter bit his lip. "Not Russ?" He finally replied. "Kind of surprised Evans doesn't call you that, honestly. It suits you, in an odd way. Especially when you smile like that." The bell rang, and they both started. "Well, see you around, Russ!" Peter sauntered away, throwing a wink back over his shoulder before disappearing around a corner.

Severus was left standing in utter bewilderment. *What the fuck just happened? And why are my cheeks burning?*

-----

The next morning, Severus was running later than usual. Consequently, when he walked into the great hall for breakfast, the Marauders were already there. Sirius was sitting apart from the others, halfway down the table, staring morosely at the other three, who were all at the near end of the Gryffindor table. James and Remus were talking quietly to each other, heads bent over something, but Peter looked up and called out, "heya, Russ!"

The other three Marauders looked up at that, and Severus found that Peter had been right yesterday as he called back, "'morning, Pete!" James' jaw dropped like it had detached itself, and Remus looked as if he'd been slapped with a trout. Sirius, further down, turned from morose to baleful, despite also looking as if he'd suddenly lost a buttock. The word 'gob-smacked' chased itself around Severus' mind as he grinned at Peter. "You were right, it seems. Shall I floo St. Mungos?"

Peter glanced over at the other three, not even bothering to stifle a giggle. "Nah, let me enjoy this for a bit." His eyes sparkled with mirth, and Severus smirked.

"Fair enough. See you in Potions, then!" He nodded to the others and left for the Slytherin table. He'd just sat down when he heard James finally squeak out, "*Russ!?*"

-----

Over the next few months, Peter and Severus began to meet up in the library to study. Peter, it turned out, wanted to be a Healer, and was rather good at Potions. Not as good as Severus, of course, but good enough that Severus was surprised to find Peter quite capable of holding his own during some very technical discussions. He was also significantly better at Herbology than Severus, which meant that the two were very much on equal footing intellectually. It was a pleasant shock, and Severus quickly found himself looking forward to their study times.

Peter was still a Marauder, however, and had a wicked sense of humor that frequently found outlet in flirtatious comments, which never failed to cause Severus to blush, and frequently left him too flustered to respond with his usual dry sarcasm. It was usually all he could do to scowl, but his lips kept twitching, so the scowls never had any bite to them.

"You enjoy tormenting me, don't you," he growled finally, after Peter had made a comment about his voice rumbling like a panther in heat.

"Yup!" Peter responded, grinning shamelessly. "You're cute when you're flustered. Just wish you'd take the hint already. I've been flirting shamelessly for near 8 months now!"

Severus felt his jaw drop. *Wait, he was serious this whole time? Bugger.* "Oh." Was all he managed to reply; it came out as little more than a squeak. His cheeks, already burning from the panther comment, now felt as if they'd caught fire.

Peter's eyes widened. "You couldn't tell? Merlin, you *are* oblivious! If I got any more blatant I'd've been propositioning you, and I bet you'd *still* think I was joking!" He sighed and began knocking his forehead against the library table, muttering "stupid stupid *stupid!* Why couldn't I have fancied a bloke with a *clue?*"

*'Fancied?'* Suddenly a number of things clicked in Severus' mind, and he came to several unexpected conclusions. First, that he was not, in fact, as straight as he'd assumed. Second, that he hadn't the slightest idea how to flirt. And third, and perhaps both most and least surprising, was that he really did want to flirt back.

"Pete?" Severus queried, voice cracking - a far cry from the 'panther in heat' Peter had claimed. "You, er, fancy me? You're not just teasing?"

Peter looked up, locking eyes with him. "Marauder's honor, I meant every word."

"Why didn't you just ask me to Hogsmeade or something, then?"

Peter's jaw dropped this time. "I, uh..."

"Well?" Severus prompted, his smirk returning though his cheeks were still blazing. "Panther got your tongue?"

Severus was gratified to find he'd managed to turn the tables. Peter had blushed so profusely that it'd spread down his neck, and he found himself wondering just how far down it went.

"You, I, uh... after James and Lily I... " Peter shook his head. "Fuck it. Russ, will you come to Hogsmeade with me next weekend?"

A genuine smile crossed Severus' face at Peter's hopeful expression. "Yes, Pete, I will. On one condition," he continued as Peter's eyes lit up. "We stay far, *far* away from Madame Puddifoot's."

"Ugh, definitely," Peter replied. An enormous grin bloomed on his face. "I know this great little place down a side street, though. You'll love it!"
