# Year 1 - Ch. 3 - Diagon and On
Over lunch at the Leaky Cauldron, Hagrid told Harry about the Dark Lord Voldemort, the night his parents were killed, and various related aspects of wixen culture. Harry was shocked to find he was famous for killing Voldemort as a baby. And something about the story bothered him: how did anyone know what had happened if he was the only witness? It sounded like one of Dudley's lies, really.

Harry and Hagrid finally continued their shopping. Their next stop was Flourish & Blott's, a large bookstore. Harry quickly found the year's required textbooks, and then was immediately distracted by the multitude of other books. There were even a few about him, which was rather disconcerting.

"Is that really what people say about me?" He muttered, thumbing through one. "I should be so lucky."

Putting the book back, he was just about to walk across the aisle to another section when he was nearly run over by a girl. She had bushy brown hair and dark skin, and was carrying a stack of books so tall she could barely see over them. She was also dressed in a pink t-shirt, jeans, and black canvas trainers - muggle clothing, which stood out among all the robes.

"Hermione! You nearly ran this poor child over! Apologize right now, please." A person, who looked just like an older version of their daughter, called out. The girl, Hermione, stopped short and looked around. Noticing Harry, with a deer-in-the-headlights look, standing next to her, she blushed and lowered her eyes.

"Hi, I'm Hermione. I'm sorry I nearly ran you over." She looked up again, a hopeful smile on her face.

Harry smiled back. "Hi Hermione, I'm Harry. No harm done. Are you going to Hogwarts too?"

Hermione's eyes lit up. "I am! Are you? Oh, I was *ever* so excited when I got my letter! I thought it was a joke at first, of course, but then Professor McGonagall here paid a visit this morning and turned our sofa into a St. Bernard..."

Hermione kept chattering as Harry glanced at the adults who had gathered behind her. Two of them were obviously her parents; they looked too much like her to be anything else, except maybe siblings, though they didn't look enough like each other for that. The last must be this Professor McGonagall; she certainly had a professorial air about her. She was tall, wearing emerald-green robes, and had raven-black hair in a severe bun. Her expression was stern, but her eyes sparkled with amusement at Hermione's exuberance.

"... but there's just so much to learn! Anyway, these are my parents and Prof. McGonagall."

One of Hermione's parents stepped forward to shake hands. "Emerson Granger, and my spouse Danika. How do you do?"

"Harry Potter," Harry said. Professor McGonagall did a double-take. Harry had never actually seen a real person do one before, and was having a hard time keeping a straight face.

"Harry Potter?" McGonagall said faintly, before bustling forward herself and peering at him. "Ah, yes. You have your mother's eyes, and your father's inimitable hair. But where is Hagrid? I thought he was to be your chaperone today."

"He's around here somewhere," Harry replied, before shooting a confused look at Hermione. Her eyes had widened dramatically at his name a second ago.

"Are you really *the* Harry Potter? Only, you're in books," she said. "They say you defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort when you were a baby, and then disappeared to have all sorts of adventures."

"I wish my life were so good," Harry lamented. "Hagrid told me that my parents were killed when I was a baby and he pulled me out of the wreckage, but that's the only true part. I've certainly never had all those adventures. I didn't even know about magic until today; I've been living with my aunt and uncle and they hate anything, well, abnormal."

"That puts us on the same footing, then," Hermione smiled. "We can learn about all this together."

"I'd like that," Harry smiled back. "I've never had a friend before."

"Me either," Hermione replied.

Just then Hagrid appeared from around a shelf. "P'fessor McGonagall! Harry, this is the Deputy Headmistress at Hogwarts. Good day, Professor!"

"Hello, Hagrid. How was finding Mr. Potter?"

"Weren't easy, P'fessor. Those Dursleys had 'im out on a wee lump o' rock out at sea. They were in a shack when I found 'em, thunderstorm an' all. Had a bit o' nuisance from the aunt, but we got away fine. Did ye know," his voice rose, "those great muggles didn't tell him NUTHIN'? About *anythin'*? He thought 'is parents died in a *car crash*, fer Merlin's sake!"

Professor McGonagall looked worried at this. "A car crash? I... I shall need to speak with the Headmaster about this."

"Finish your shopping with us, Harry, and then Hagrid and Professor McGonagall can return to Hogwarts together," Hermione suggested.

"Sounds good to me," Harry said, looking to Hagrid. "Is that alright with you, Hagrid?"

"'s fine," Hagrid nodded. "Well, best be payin' fer yer books, then, we've plenty more to go yet."

Harry paid for his books; along with his schoolbooks, he'd picked up a few on various other topics that seemed interesting. Hermione had a much larger stack, and looked envious as Harry placed his purchases in his new bag.

Danika laughed. "See, Hermione, I told you we should have gotten your luggage first. The books aren't going anywhere, and wouldn't it be nice to have something to carry them in?"

"I suppose you're right," Hermione sighed. "Can we go there next, then?"

"I could help you pick one out," Harry said. "We just came from there. The shopkeeper's really nice."

They all trooped back to Packard's, where the shopkeeper greeted Harry pleasantly.

"Hello, Mr. Potter. Back so soon?"

"Hello, sir. My friend here needs her Hogwarts trunk, and probably a book-bag like mine," Harry replied.

The shopkeeper proceeded to explain about his wares to the Grangers, just as he had to Harry. Hermione ended up with an oak trunk with brass fittings, and a tan leather book-bag, also with brass fittings. Both had featherlight and space expansion enchantments as well.

They continued on to other shops. Eventually, they'd collected everything except their wands and Hermione's robes. When they reached Ollivander's, it was too crowded for everyone, so Emerson and Hagrid opted to wait outside.

The others entered into a dim, dusty front area. There was a bench beneath the window, where Danika and Prof. McGonagall sat to wait, and an empty counter with a bell on it. Beyond, there were rows and rows of shelves stuffed full of boxes.

A dry voice spoke from behind them. "Ah, Professor McGonagall. Fir, 9 1/2 inches and quite stiff, with a dragon heart-string from a particularly fine Hebridean Black. Well-suited to Transfiguration, of course."

They all jumped, turning to see a wizened old man peering at them intently. "And Harry Potter. A pleasure to finally meet you. It seems like only yesterday you mother was here buying her own wand. Willow, 10 1/4 inches. Rather swishy, and quite nice for Charms. Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand of a pliable 11 inches; excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say he favoured it, but it's really the wand which favoured him. The wand chooses the wizard, or witch, after all."

Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry was excited to hear something about his parents. Hermione seemed excited too. "Different wands favour different kinds of magic, then?" She asked.

"To a degree," Ollivander replied. "Wand lore is a rather complex subject, and I don't think there is time to delve into the intricacies just now, but essentially yes. Just as a witch or wizard may favour a particular kind of magic, so may their wand. Now then," he clapped his hands, "Let's start with you, Miss Granger. Which is your wand hand?"

"Well, I write with my right," she replied hesitantly.

"That will do. Hold it out, please."

Hermione did so, and another floating tape measure began to take measurements as Ollivander darted over to the shelves and returned with a box.

"Ebony and unicorn hair, springy, 8 1/2 inches. Just give it a swish."

Hermione took the wand and swished it, but nothing happened. Ollivander quickly took it back and swapped it for another. "Beechwood and dragon heart-string, 9 inches, nice and flexible."

Hermione gave this one a swish as well.

"Almost. Hmm. Yes, yes, why not?" Ollivander swapped the wand again. "Vine wood and dragon heart-string, 10 3/4 inches, snappy."

As soon as Hermione touched this wand, a glow surrounded her and her hair crackled. She gave it a swish, and silver sparks spouted from the tip.

"Excellent, yes, just perfect," Ollivander crowed. "And now you, Mr. Potter."

Harry stepped forward, holding out his right hand, and the floating tape began to measure him. Harry wondered just what this was for, as Ollivander seemed to ignore it completely when matching Hermione to her wand.

"Let's start with this one, shall we?" Ollivander handed him a wand. "Maple and phoenix feather, 7 inches, quite whippy."

Harry gave it a swish, but it just felt off somehow.

Ollivander snatched it back. "No, that's not quite right, is it?"

Harry tried wand after wand for nearly half an hour.

"Tricky customer, eh?" Ollivander said. "Well, that can happen, of course. Not to worry, we'll find one for you yet! I wonder... yes, yes, why not?" He darted off to the back of the shelves, and returned with a very dusty box.

"Holly and phoenix feather, 11 inches, nice and supple."

Harry took hold of the wand, and immediately felt a warmth suffuse his arm. Giving it a fluid wave, a warm glow surrounded him and a waterfall of gold sparks poured from the tip.

"Excellent!" Ollivander cried. "And curious, at that..."

"What's curious, sir?" Harry asked.

"You see, Mr. Potter, I remember every wand I've ever sold. Every wand. And the phoenix who gave the feather for your wand gave only one other. It's curious, you see, that you would match with this wand when its brother - why, its brother gave you that scar!"

A shudder went through Harry at that, and Hermione's eyes widened.

"I think we should expect great things from you, Mr. Potter," Ollivander continued. "After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named also did great things. Terrible, yes, but great nonetheless."

Thoroughly disconcerted, Harry could only nod.

"Yes, well," Professor McGonagall interjected. "We really must be getting on with our shopping."

"Of course, of course," Ollivander replied. "That will be 7 galleons for each of your wands."

They all paid and trooped back out into the sunlight, blinking at the brightness. Hagrid and Emerson were waiting for them, and both had grins on their faces and cages in their hands.

"Happy birthday, Harry! I got ye a present!" Hagrid boomed, handing his cage to Harry. Inside was a beautiful snowy owl, with brilliant white plumage and piercing amber eyes.

"She's beautiful, Hagrid, thank you!" Harry gave Hagrid a hug.

Emerson held their own cage up to show Danika and Hermione. "It's a Tengmalm's owl, the shop-keep said. Dead useful. They carry post, did you know? We can write to our Hermione while she's away, now, and maybe subscribe to that Daily Prophet we keep hearing about."

"Oh, he's lovely!" Hermione squealed.

Danika leaned in and cooed at the owl. "Oh, aren't you a handsome thing? Have you named him yet, Em?"

"Not officially," Emerson answered. "I was thinking Puck."

Hermione and Danika agreed. "That's perfect!"

Harry reached through the bars of his owl's cage. "I think I'll name mine Hedwig."

"After the Polish saint?" Hermione asked.

Harry shrugged, stroking Hedwig through the bars. "I suppose? I saw the name when I was leafing through the History of Magic textbook earlier and it sounded right."

"Well, it's lovely," Hermione replied.

"Good, so is she," Harry said with a grin.

Hedwig puffed her feathers, looking pleased at the compliments.

They continued discussing their owls as they headed back towards Madam Malkin's so Hermione could get her robes. Harry realized that he didn't have any new muggle clothes, and went in with her to see if they sold any. They both came out several galleons lighter and with new wardrobes. Hermione had also gotten robes for casual wear, and Harry came out with several pairs of shirts and slacks which, while similar to the Hogwarts uniform equivalents in cut, were more varied in colour and fabric. Harry had changed back into Dudley's hand-me-downs again so as not to perturb the Dursleys when he returned.

They all trooped back to the Leaky Cauldron for a quick supper before returning home. The Grangers were parked just outside, and Professor McGonagall would return Harry to Privet Drive via side-along apparition before accompanying Hagrid back to Hogwarts.

Before they left, Hermione and Harry exchanged addresses and phone numbers. Even though they had owls, Harry figured his aunt and uncle would make less of a fuss if they used less overtly magical means to keep in touch.

"Good-bye, Harry! I'll see you in a month!" Hermione waved before following her parents outside.

Harry waved back. He couldn't wait. A new friend, ten whole months away from the Dursleys, and he got to learn magic as well! September the First couldn't arrive soon enough.
