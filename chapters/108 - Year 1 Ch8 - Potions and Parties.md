# Year 1, Chapter 8 - Potions and Parties

After such an eventful day, Harry slept like the dead and woke with a spring in his step. He waved to Neville, who fell into step with them as he and the other Slytherin first-years left breakfast, and they all made their way to their first Potions class.

Pansy was already there, waiting in front of the closed classroom door. She scowled at them before turning her pug-nose up with a "hmph!"

Before anyone could respond, the classroom door opened and Professor Snape loomed in the doorway. "Well, what are you all waiting for? Inside," he growled.

They all filed in and took their seats. Harry ended up next to Hermione, and Ron next to Draco. The rest of the room divided by house, with Slytherins on one side and Gryffindors on the other. Despite Neville's burgeoning friendship with so many of the 1st-Year Slytherins, the two houses remained wary of each other.

Snape began to take roll, speaking in a quiet rumble that had the entire class silent immediately. He paused upon reaching Harry's name.

"Ah, yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new... *celebrity.*" Pansy sniggered, and Snape turned a baleful eye upon her. She gulped and promptly shut up.

Snaped finished roll call and began pacing among the desks. "You are here," he said with quiet menace, "to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving in this class, many of you will hardly believe this is magic at all. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper on death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." He finished with a low snarl. Harry and Hermione looked at each other, both vowing to prove they weren't dunderheads.

"Potter!" Snape said suddenly, locking eyes with him. "What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"

Startled, Harry stammered for a moment before remembering having read the correct page over the summer. "Um, wormwood, as in *Artemisia Absinthium?* The Draught of Living Death, sir, isn't it?"

Snape gave him a nod, saying to the rest of the class, "Well. Five points to Slytherin. Fame clearly isn't everything, and Potter here seems to have realized that. No excuses for the rest of you. Parkinson!" He whirled to face her. "Where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?"

Pansy looked quite taken aback, and gaped like a fish for a few moments. "I - um - I don't know, sir." She whimpered.

"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Parkinson? Stay after class. Longbottom!" Snape turned to face Neville, leaving Pansy shrinking back in her seat and causing Neville to jump in his seat. "What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?"

Neville's face lit up. "They're the same plant, sir. Aconite. It's got several other names as well, most notable being Queen of Poisons."

Snape smiled. The effect was somewhat disconcerting on such a dour face, and Neville faltered. "Queen of Poisons. 5 points, Longbottom, and this brings me to my next point. We will be working with dangerous materials in this class. There will be no horseplay, or *pranks,*" he swept a glare across the class, "and if I catch you throwing something into someone else's cauldron you'll be in detention scrubbing bedpans the Muggle way for the rest of the year *at best.* I will come down on you so hard you'll wish you'd never been born. Do I make myself *perfectly* clear?"

"Yes, sir!" The Slytherins all chorused. The Gryffindors haltingly followed suit after a stunned moment.

"For your information, Miss Parkinson," Snape continued, "a bezoar can be found in the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. For this reason, there is a stock on hand in the supply cupboard. Well? Why aren't you all writing this down?"

There was a scramble for quills and parchment, and Snape began instructing them on a simple potion to cure boils. He prowled between the desks as they all weighed dried nettles, crushed snake fangs, and so on, with an air of preparing to pounce upon the slightest mistake.
