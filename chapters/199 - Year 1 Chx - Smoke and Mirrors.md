# Year 1 - Endgame - Smoke and Mirrors
## First year, in the Mirror Chamber:

"You!"

Professor Quirrell turned around. "Yes, me," he said. "Now put that wand down before you hurt someone. We haven't much t-t-t-time."

"Professor, what-?" Harry's question cut off abruptly as Quirrell, with a grunt of impatience and a muttered "*impedimentia*," trussed him up like a Christmas goose and turned back to the mirror occupying the centre of the round stone room.

Harry squirmed over so he could see into the mirror. Instead of his reflection, the mirror showed a young girl, dressed like him, with the same green eyes. She had long black hair in waves and ringlets, and the same lightning-bolt scar could be seen on her forehead through her bangs. She winked at Harry, put a finger to her lips, and pulled a reddish crystal from her pocket before quickly replacing it. As she did so, Harry felt a lump appear in his own pocket.

"The... child!" Harry heard a muffled voice rasp - from under Quirrell's turban? "Let... me... speak... to... him..."

"A-a-are you sure? Time runs sh-sh-short..."

"There... is... enough..." The voice rasped. 

Quirrell turned his back to Harry with a sigh. "As y-y-you wish." He knelt and began to unwrap his turban. A smell like ozone and burnt hair permeated the room, and as the last of the turban fell away, Harry saw a face on the back of Quirrell's head. Or was it? Looking closer, he could see masses of scar tissue surrounding gleaming metal and blinking lights. Yet the overall effect was of a grotesque face. And as the face spoke, the impression was solidified.

"Harry Potter," the voice rasped. It was high and thin, little more than a rough whisper. "You see what I've been reduced to - a ghost in the machine, little more than smoke. I will make this quick. The storage matrix is failing and your professor cannot last much longer. Give me the Stone, and he may yet live."

Quirrell gestured, and the ropes around Harry disappeared.

Harry got to his feet, staring in horror. "V-v-voldemort?"

"Yes. Please, child, give us the Stone. Time grows short. The matrix must be stabilized, or Quirinus will be lost."

Harry reached into his pocket, closing his fist around the Stone. "What do you care about Professor Quirrell? You're just using him! You just want the stone so you can have a body again!"

Voldemort sighed. "I swear on my magic that I am trying to save Quirinus." 

A glow surrounded Quirrell's head, and he hissed in pain. "The m-m-matrix can't s-s-sustain m-m-much m-m-more!"

"Quickly, Harry! Give us the Stone!"

Harry squeezed his eyes shut - and walked forward to place the stone in Quirrell's hand. He backed away slowly as a golden glow suffused the professor; suddenly, though, it turned a deep red.

"It's a fake!"

"The m-m-matrix is failing!"

"There's no more time! I'm sorry, my friend. This is going to hurt."

Smoke was pouring out of Quirrell's ears, thick and black and acrid, and angry sparks leapt around his head.

"I'm s-s-sorry, V."

"We'll meet again in Elysium, Quirinus. Harry Potter, I shall return one day. We have much to discuss. For now, run!"

Quirrell let out a scream. His body erupted in flames, bright and hot enough to singe Harry's eyebrows from feet away. Then something exploded, and the blast threw Harry against the far wall. Everything went black.
