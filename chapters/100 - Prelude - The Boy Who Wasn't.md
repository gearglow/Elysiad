# Prelude - The Boy Who Wasn't
The whole of magical Britain knew the story of The Boy Who Lived.

Or, at least, they thought they did. In truth, Harry Potter neither felt much like a boy, nor that his continued existence could really be called *living*.

He wore the label of 'boy' like he wore his cousin Dudley's hand-me-downs. Neither fit, but what choice was there? He'd been abandoned on the Dursleys' doorstep one Halloween night, all trick and no treat, and they'd begrudgingly taken him in. It wasn't so bad at first, he supposed; he'd been too young to know better, after all. But when he was around 4 or 5 years old and first starting kindergarten with Dudley, he'd lined up with the girls to go outside to play and the teacher had sent a note home with him. That was when he'd been moved to the cupboard under the stairs.

From then on, Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia only called him 'boy.' And things steadily got worse and worse. And Harry gave in, kept his head down, and just tried to survive.
