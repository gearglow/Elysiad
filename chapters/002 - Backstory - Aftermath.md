# Aftermath - Halloween, 1981

*"Lily and James, Sirius! How could you-!?" Peter yelled.* Why would she cheat? *Peter wondered for a moment. And anyway, Sirius knew James was a beard, not a lover. Something suspicious was going on.*

*Sirius roared, and Peter panicked.* Shitshitshitgottadisappear-! *With shaking hands, Peter aimed a blasting hex behind him, hoping the distraction would be enough to slip away.*

*The blast was much* MUCH *bigger than expected. Peter was already moving by the time the spell landed, and so was already hiding down a storm drain as the gas line shattered and all hell broke loose.* Nothing else for it, *he thought, in shock, and sliced off a finger with a shaky* diffindo. They'll all think it's my fault. I'll have to fake my death. *He threw his ex-finger out into the middle of the crater, and promptly turned around and emptied his stomach.*

----------

## 1-Nov-1981 22:15

*How did it all go so pear-shaped?* Peter wondered, staring out from the storm drain in horror. The crater which used to be an ordinary muggle street was still on fire; he could see bodies, charred and broken, and across the crater, through the smoke and dust, a wizard with long black hair was just starting to stir.

*Sirius,* Peter thought. *Oh, Padfoot, I'm so sorry.* He considered checking on him for a moment, but discarded the thought as a team of aurors apparated in.

Sirius was, by this time, sitting up and looking around dazedly. Peter watched as the aurors approached him, as Sirius began to laugh hysterically, sobbing and rocking back and forth. Even from this distance, Sirius could be heard repeating, "I killed them. All my fault. They're dead."

Peter's heart broke.

One of the aurors finally stunned him and dropped a portkey on him; the others spread out to contain the scene.

With one last mournful look, he made his escape down the sewers.

Finding a wide spot in the pipes, Peter had taken a moment to resume his human form and heal the finger he'd cut off during his escape ploy. As the adrenaline left his system, it was all he could do to huddle himself into a corner and weep.

Eventually, his thoughts wandered. He remembered Hogwarts, how close the four Marauders had been. Like brothers - closer than brothers, in Sirius' case. And then the end of 6th year came, and Snape had nearly been killed by Moony, and suddenly the only one holding the group together was Peter, somehow. He remembered coaxing the others to talk about that night; at first, it was purely because he hadn't been there and had no idea what had happened, but then it was because he couldn't stand to see his brothers torn apart. Not after all they'd been through together.

Sirius had been the trickiest, because they all had a hard time forgiving him for betraying Moony, even if all he'd actually done was egging on Severus. But Sirius had been so heartfelt in his apologies, and so desperately sorry, that eventually James and Remus had caved. Peter, however, despite trying to keep them all together, still remained somewhat distant from Sirius. And dating Severus had widened the rift still further.

That was going to bite Padfoot in the tail, Peter mused. Sirius had already betrayed them all once; it was all too easy to believe he'd done it again. And it *hurt* to let everyone believe it, and to betray Sirius himself. He could only hope Moony would manage to help Padfoot, or that the trial would keep him out of Azkaban; but then, that would make Wormtail himself a wanted man.

*Nothing else for it, then,* he decided. *I'll check in with Purgatory to be sure, but it looks like I'll be stuck as Wormtail for the foreseeable future. How appropriate, I certainly feel like a rat.*

With a shuddering sigh, he withdrew a mokeskin pouch from his robes and pulled out a small metal rectangle with a clasp along one edge. It looked a lot like a cross between a clutch purse and a cigar box, and it was vibrating gently and pulsing hot every minute or so. Opening it revealed a mirrored surface inside the lid, and a typewriter-esque keyboard on the lower half. He tapped a key and the mirror flickered, showing the words "PURGATORY FIELD ACCESS TERMINAL" in glowing white block print across the top of the mirror-screen.

Peter let out a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding. *Lily's alive! Oh thank Merlin!* And Riddle was too, which boded very well for Peter's own future. *Poor James, though.* He allowed himself to grieve for his once-brother, finally, and felt the tears well up again.

*Oh Prongs, if only you'd listened to me,* he sobbed, remembering the one time he'd tried to approach him about Dumbledore's insidious manipulations. James had reacted badly and threatened to hex Peter until he'd been obliviated. Lily had been more receptive, especially considering her rekindled friendship with Severus. By then she'd already given birth to Harry, though, and been forced into hiding by James and Dumbledore.

*What about Harry,* Peter thought. *Maybe Remus knows.*

The mirror-screen darkened, and Peter snapped the terminal shut, stuffing it back in his pocket. *Happy birthday, Padfoot,* he thought bitterly. With one last, shuddering sigh, he turned on his heel and vanished with a small *pop.*

Peter sat on a swing in the park between Magnolia and Privet, scuffing his toe in the dirt and letting his thoughts drift as he waited for Rookwood. Lily was with Remus. Harry's mother was alive. The Resurrection Cask was nowhere near finished, though, so who knew *how* long it'd be before she had a body again. Nobody was even sure if she could be linked to Elysium. *That's close enough to dead,* Peter supposed. *She can't exactly take care of a child in such a state. Poor Lily. Someday, though, they'll be together again. Unlike the Marauders.*

His thoughts turns from sorrowful to bitter. Sirius had been in the paper that morning; he'd been thrown straight into Azkaban's top-security wing for life, without a trial or even a sentencing hearing, and Bartemius Crouch Sr. had *gloated.* James was dead, killed by his own headstrong recklessness and pure bad luck, and Peter himself was presumed dead. Remus had been isolated so completely in one fell swoop, and even though they both knew Peter wasn't dead, and that Sirius was innocent, there was nothing at all they could do about it.

So where did that leave Harry? Peter knew that James and Lily's will had said that Harry should be raised by Frank and Alice Longbottom should it become necessary, and that Harry was *never* to be raised by Petunia and her husband. But somehow there he was. *Better Frank and Alice than those Dursleys. They're aurors, but almost anyone would be better than the Dursleys.* Still, the Inner Circle was no place to raise a baby. *Lucius and Narcissa, perhaps?* If they were able to get through the blood wards in the first place. The longer Peter thought about it, the more it seemed like the Longbottoms were the only possibility to rescue Harry from the Dursleys if the blood wards proved insurmountable.

As he was pondering, a wizard in a dark grey trench-coat and fedora appeared in front of him with a small *pop* like a wine bottle opening.

"Gus."

"Pete."

Peter gestured to the empty swing at his side. Gus settled into it with a huff.

"What's the plan?" Peter asked, twisting his swing to face the other wizard.

Gus hummed tunelessly. "Well, first step is to make sure we're not observed." He drew his wand and cast a number of spells under his breath. "There. Looks like there are some passive detection wards on the entire neighborhood, but they're only tuned to strong or dark magic. Subtle is the watchword."

Peter stood. "Shall we proceed to the house itself, then?"

Gus withdrew two pairs of what appeared to be antique aviator's goggles from his pocket and handed one pair to Peter. "Let's. You'll want these, I expect."

Peter donned the goggles, and as he pulled them over his eyes a light rose-tinted fog became visible rising in a dome overhead. The detection wards, presumably.

The two wizards proceeded down Privet Drive to #4, stopping in front of the house next door with a gasp. Through the goggles, #4 was completely hidden by a blazing, swirling dome of so many colors of light that it appeared almost blinding white.

Gus swore and fiddled with a small dial on one side of the goggles. "Better. Peter, there's a cluster of dials on the right side lens; find the lowest one and turn it widdershins."

Peter complied and let out a sigh of relief as the dome's glare dimmed and he could make out the individual colors - and patterns, as it turned out. He watched as Gus pulled out his field terminal, drew his wand, tapped it first to the terminal, then to his goggles and Peter's, and proceeded to cast diagnostic spell after diagnostic spell. Rune diagrams overlayed themselves in Peter's vision, melding seamlessly with the glowing dome, as Gus narrated.

"Well, Pete, you were right. The outer layer is exactly the wix-repelling ward you thought it was. Looks like the next one keeps out anyone who intends to remove the child permanently. And... Merlin's balls! Layer 3 is effectively behavioral modification for the other occupants. Amplifies their negative emotions concerning the child, and damps down the positive. And you say they already hate magic?"

Peter, jaw dropped in horror, could only nod.

Gus swore again. "This child needs to be rescued before they kill him. Well, that's all I can do with this." He opened his terminal, tapped a few keys, and then packed it away.

Peter nodded. "Let's get out of this hellhole. See you at HQ?"

Gus nodded back. "Aye. Hope someone has a plan."

Peter sighed sadly. "Me too. It doesn't look good, though."

Gus just shrugged, and the two disappeared with an echoed *pop* like a backfiring car.

-----

HQ, or Riddle Manor, as the muggles had known it, was once a refined country estate for a refined country squire, just outside of Little Hangleton. After Riddle's father and grandparents had been found dead (murdered by Dumbledore, or so the rumor was among the Inner Circle) in 1944, Riddle had inherited the estate. When the Inner Circle began operations in the late 1960s after Riddle's return to Magical Britain, the estate had been placed under the *Fidelius* charm, with first Abraxas and then Lucius Malfoy as secret-keeper. The manor house had undergone drastic renovations, and while the above-ground levels served their same purpose, an extensive subterranean complex had been added. These included comprehensive medical facilities, potions labs, training rooms, fabrication equipment, and the very heart of it all, Purgatory.

Purgatory was a Cray-1 supercomputer, which Lucius Malfoy had managed to procure in 1979. It had been heavily modified to run off of a ley line tap instead of electricity, and it was the communications hub for all of the Inner Circle via the field terminals, which were linked over a combination of magic mirrors and muggle fiber-optic transcievers (the boffins called it the WULF protocol). But most importantly, it was the host for Elysium, a virtual "afterlife" for disembodied souls. When Project Essence was begun in earnest from Riddle's research into soul magic, it was found that if an intact soul was anchored to an object, the soul effectively embodied that object. As such, the more ways in which the object was able to interact with its surroundings, the less bored the soul would be.

In theory, anyway. Until Halloween, there hadn't been any souls to test it. *But Riddle's still sending missives,* Peter thought as he rode the lift, *so all this technology just might be worth the effort.*

Peter and Gus had apparated into the secure arrival room, at the lowest basement sublevel. It was not only warded to the hilt, it was physically insulated from the rest of the compound by roughly 100 meters of earth and 10 meters of concrete walls. So Peter had time to think as they made their way inside the compound proper.

Finally the lift came to a halt and the doors slid open with a cheerful *ding.* They made their way to the main sitting room, where a number of others were already waiting. A large portrait-sized mirror-screen in a thick, rune-etched frame was hanging over the mantle, with a face upon it. It was a pretty face, ghostly-pale, of ambiguous gender, and with not a single hair upon it, not even eyebrows. As they took their seats, the face greeted them in an androgynous voice.

"Pettigrew, Rookwood, it's good to see you've returned safely."

"Tom," Gus nodded.

Peter started. *Tom? This was Tom Riddle now?* Recovering, he snarked, "Hullo, Tom. Glad to see that the, er, *head* of our organization is still with us."

This prompted a chorus of groans, to which Tom and Peter shared a smirk.

"Now then," Tom said. "To order. Peter, Augustus, what is Harry's situation?"

They explained their findings, and Peter expounded on his earlier musings. "As Gus said, those wards are too powerful to get past any time soon, and impossible without blowing our cover. We can't Gryffindor our way through a rescue. But I happen to know that the Potters' will specified that Harry was to be raised by the Longbottoms if anything happened to them, and then Sirius Black if they were unable. Now, with Sirius in Azkaban the Longbottoms are our best chance to get Harry away from the Dursleys."

"Chief Warlock Dumbledore ordered the will sealed," Lucius Malfoy interjected. "I believe the Longbottoms may be targeted to remove them from the equation."

"Cousin Sirius was an auror," Bellatrix Lestrange said. "If he of all people didn't get a trial, there must have been some interference. I think you're right, Lucius."

"Then we must ensure their safety," Tom ordered. "I believe they have just emerged from the Fidelius. Bellatrix, Rodolphus, Rabastan, Bartemius, this is your new assignment. Guard the Longbottoms, and make sure no-one *interferes.* Lucius," he continued, "see what you can do about getting that will read in an open session."

Lucius nodded. "I'll try. There may be some technicalities which can be leveraged."

"Excellent. And Augustus, see what you can do about the wards imprisoning young Harry. Swiftly now, all of you, time is of the essence. Peter, stay a moment."

The room swiftly emptied, and soon only Peter and Tom were left.

"Peter, you are in a unique position, and I find we need eyes in tight places. You know of Arthur Weasley?"

"Yes," Peter nodded. "Works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, right?"

"That's the one," Tom replied. "He's just been promoted to Head of that office, and has expressed a degree of affection for muggles that would make him both a useful ally and a target for the more extreme elements of our society. I don't anticipate any immediate threat, but feel it is prudent to have some measures in place in advance. You will be this measure. Further, we need unrestricted eyes on Dumbledore. Severus is being observed far too closely, but if you were to, say, masquerade as a student's pet rat, you would have free run of Hogwarts."

Peter's eyes widened. A deep-cover assignment was nothing new for him, but as a pet? Still, nobody knew Hogwarts like a Marauder, and it would maintain the charade of his faked death. There were worse afterlives, he supposed. And he'd be close to Severus.

"Understood," he finally acknowledged. "The eldest Weasley boy, William, is starting at Hogwarts next year. It'll be a few months, but my position should be secure once established."

"Thank you, Peter. There is no rush on this assignment, so please rest up and ensure you are fully provisioned. Take some time to mourn, my friend."
