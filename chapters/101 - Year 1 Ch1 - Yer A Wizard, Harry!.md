## Year 1 - Ch. 1 - "Yer A Wizard, Harry!"
It was a dark and stormy night. The air was cold and wet. You didn't have to be a seer to feel that something big was coming. Of course, Harry had no idea yet just *how* big.

He'd been laying on the ground huddled under a poor excuse for a blanket, staring at the glowing hands of Dudley's watch; at midnight, it would be his eleventh birthday. And as the hands moved together, striking 12, the storm peaked with a roar and the door shuddered under a ferocious knocking, before falling clean off its hinges.

A disconcertingly large and wild-looking man was silhouetted in a flash of lightning as he stepped through the doorway. Dudley, on the sofa, had jerked awake as Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon hurried into the room. The giant man stooped to fit the door back into place, reducing the storm to a dull roar, then turned to face them.

"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey." The stranger strode to the sofa, where Dudley sat petrified. "Budge up, yeh great lump," the man continued.

Dudley let out a squeak, tripping over - in succession - his feet, the now-tangled blanket, and a loose floorboard as he scrambled to hide behind his parents. Harry was torn between laughing and backing into a corner himself.

"Well, now, Harry," the stranger said as he settled on the couch, causing a symphony of groaning springs even greater than Dudley had, "it's good ter see ye again. I've got summat for ya here, just a sec." He rummaged around in the pockets of his coat, which was as large and hairy as he was, and pulled out a somewhat misshapen box. "Happy birthday."

Harry accepted the box, automatically opening it to find a slightly squashed cake inside. "Um, thank you, but... who are you? And how do you know my name?"

"O' course, you wouldn' remember me, would ye? Haven't seen ye since ye were a baby. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of keys and Grounds at Hogwarts. Ye'll know all abou' Hogwarts, o' course."

"Sorry, no," Harry said, not entirely sure this wasn't just some bizarre dream. "What's a Hogwarts?"

Hagrid looked shocked. "What's a - do you mean ta tell me tha ye don't know? Ye've been down for Hogwarts since ye were born!"

Harry thought that this sounded rather unpleasant, like chicken pox.

"Yer parents both went, and top o' their class they were, too," Hagrid continued. "Head Boy and Girl in their day."

"So Hogwarts is a school, then?" Harry asked, only slightly less confused.

"Only the greatest school o' magic in Britain!" Hagrid looked outraged. "Didn't those muggles ye live with tell ye anythin'?"

"'Don't ask questions,' mostly," Harry muttered. "Maybe you should start at the beginning. And what's a muggle?"

"Non-magical folk. Like yer lump of a cousin, there." Hagrid waved one slab-like hand at the Dursleys huddled in the back of the room. Harry'd forgotten they were there.

"Normal people, he means, not freaks like you and your freak parents," Vernon countered, "lazy layabouts. Died in a car crash, probably drunk, and you'll meet the same end, mark my words!"

"A car crash!?" Hagrid growled, "As if a car crash could stop James an' Lily Potter!" With a roar, he stood and pulled a large pink umbrella from his pocket. He pointed it at the Dursleys, and there was a flash. Dudley clapped his hands to his rear with a pig-like squeal and ran into the back room, his parents following. Harry could see a curly pink tail sticking through Dudley's fingers.

"What did you do?" Harry cried in a panic.

"Tried te turn him inta a pig," Hagrid replied, glaring at his umbrella before stuffing it back into a pocket. "Suppose he were mostly there already. I'd appreciate ye not sayin' anythin' about this."

"That - that was magic. Real magic! Is that what they teach at Hogwarts? Can I learn to do that too?" Harry knew he was babbling, but couldn't stop himself. Hysteria seemed to have set in.

"'Course you can," Hagrid replied with a wink. "Ye'r a wizard, Harry!"

*And you're a hairy wizard*, Harry's hysterical mind shot back. He managed to keep from actually saying it, although a nervous giggle escaped.

"Or ye will be, anyway, once ye've been taught. An' a right good 'un, too, bein' James an' Lily's kid," Hagrid continued. "Oh, tha' reminds me." He pulled a familiar-looking envelope from his pocket and handed it to Harry with a flourish. It was the letter that had started the chain of events leading to Uncle Vernon's mad dash to isolation, dragging his family and Harry with him. He would finally get to read it!

The envelope was addressed in emerald ink to H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-rock, The Sea. Harry opened it to find a letter, written on a strange sort of paper in the same emerald ink, informing him that he was accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as well as a list of required supplies.

"What does it mean, they await my owl?" Harry asked.

"Oh, right, that." Hagrid rooted around in his pockets again, pulling out a roll of parchment, a quill pen, and a live, rather ruffled-looking owl. Scribbling a note, he rolled the parchment up and handed it to the owl, who clamped the letter firmly in its beak. He then scooped up the owl, opened the door, and tossed the owl out into the storm, before sitting down again as if it were as unremarkable as slipping a letter into a mailbox.

"There's that done," Hagrid said. "We'll get yer school stuff tomorrow."

"He's not going."

Harry and Hagrid whirled around to find Aunt Petunia glaring at them with her arms crossed.

"When we took him in, Vernon and I agreed that we'd stamp out this freakishness. You wizards are all mad, haven't an ounce of common sense. You all think you can just do whatever you want, and treat anyone without magic like a - a - a *thing* that you can just throw away. I won't have any part of that, and as the boy's guardian, I say neither will he. What good does magic ever do anybody anyway? Everyone thought my dear sister was so brilliant, and she went and got herself blown up before she ever really got to live. And then we get landed with the boy, and he's just as freakish as his parents, and nobody ever even asked us if we were able to raise a magical child - do you know how many times I found the boy inexplicably in dangerous circumstances, or how many times he set the drapes on fire? He could have killed us all in our sleep, and there would've been nothing we could do about it. And no way to ask for help, and nobody ever checked up on us. *It's not fair*."

Having finally run out of steam, Aunt Petunia went back to glaring at them. Harry stared at his aunt in shock.

"You *knew?* You knew about *everything?*"

"Of course I did," Petunia spat. "I'm a squib, aren't I? A whole family of freaks, and here's poor Petunia disowned for being normal. Wizards and their so-called 'pure blood' obsession. They can all go hang. In fact," Petunia fixed Harry with the most baleful glare he'd ever seen, "I've changed my mind. You can join them." She turned on her heel and flounced out of the room, slamming the door behind her.
