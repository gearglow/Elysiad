# Year 1 - Chapter 6 - Snakes

As dessert dwindled and everyone finally sat back, stuffed to the gills, Dumbledore stood. In a blink, the tables were cleared and the hall went silent.

"Now that we are all fed and watered," he said, "I have some announcements. First, allow me to introduce Professor Quirinus Quirrel, this year's Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Some of our older students may remember him as our previous Muggle Studies professor. He's just returned from sabattical, and Hogwarts is glad to have him back."

Professor Quirrell stood and waved, looking like he'd rather be hiding under the table. A smattering of applause greeted him.

"Now then," Prof. Dumbledore continued as Quirrell resumed his seat. "Our caretaker Mr. Filch has asked me to remind you all that Fanged Frisbees and Dancing Dungbombs have been added to the list of banned objects. The entire list, now comprising 347 items, can be found pinned to the door of Mr. Filch's office. Our new students are also to note," he said, eyes twinkling, "That the Forbidden Forest is, as the name suggests, strictly forbidden. Some of our returning students would do well to remember this as well." This last was aimed directly at Fred and George, who grinned and patted each other on the back loudly enough that Harry heard it across the hall.

"Quidditch tryouts will be held during the second full week of classes. Any student wishing to join their House team should contact their Head of House before Monday of that week."

Draco and Ron growled simultaneously about how unfair it was that first-years weren't allowed to join, then looked at each other in shock. Ron wrinkled his nose. Draco smirked, an expression Harry noticed was rather a common occurrence for him.

"And finally," Dumbledore announced, the twinkle in his eye fading, "The third-floor corridor on the left is off-limits to anyone who does not wish to die a very painful death." He then dismissed them amid a flurry of whispers.

"Is he serious?" Hermione asked.

"He is," said a voice from behind her. Turning, they found an older Slytherin girl walking up to them. "Gemma Fawley, 5th Year prefect," she introduced herself. "First years, please gather yourselves and follow me. It wouldn't do to get lost en route to the common room on your very first night, now, would it?"

So saying, she joined another older student, a boy this time. They lifted their wands, and green light began to glow from the tips. They corralled the first-years into a little knot at the end of the table as the older students streamed past them. As the crowd thinned, the prefects lined them up, with one prefect at the head and one bringing up the rear. Then they all marched out of the Great Hall, down the stairs, and through a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. Or so it seemed to Harry; Draco seemed entirely at ease. Hermione, however, seemed as anxious as Harry, and grabbed his hand tightly. She shivered, and Harry wasn't convinced that it was entirely because of how cold the dungeons were.

Eventually they drew up before a blank wall in the middle of a hallway, and the prefects gathered them around. "The password is 'electrum,'" Gemma said. "Do *not* let anyone in another house find out, and do *not* let anyone from another House into our common room."

The wall folded away as she said the password, in the same way that the wall at Diagon Alley had. They all followed Gemma inside, where it was much warmer, and she gestured for them to stay gathered around.

"Again, I am Gemma Fawley, and this is Fenwick Runcorn. We are your 5th-year prefects, recognizable by these badges." She pointed to Fenwick's badge, a Slytherin-green shield with a silver 'P' embossed upon it. "If you need assistance, or have a problem, you can seek one of us out."

"The password changes weekly," Fenwick continued. "Each week's password can be found posted on the House notice board." He gestured behind him, where the notice board was mounted beside the exit. There wasn't much on it yet.

"Quickly, before Professor Snape gets here, we want to impress upon you the unofficial Slytherin House Rules," Gemma said. "Rule number one: what happens in Slytherin *stays* in Slytherin. This means we project a united front to the rest of the school whenever possible, and if you have a disagreement with another Slytherin you resolve it in private. We get enough animosity from the other Houses without giving them leverage too. When in public, you are a Slytherin first, and a student of Hogwarts second. Is that clear?"

There were a few mumbles of "yes" but Gemma shouted over them. "I said, *is that clear?*"

"Yes, ma'am!" The first-years all chorused back.

"That's better," Gemma said.

"Rule number two," Fenwick picked up. "*Don't get caught.* Everyone breaks the rules. But if you get caught, then it reflects badly on the rest of us. We Slytherins have a reputation to uphold, and prejudices to overcome. We present a united front not because we all like or even tolerate each other, but because the rest of the school judges us all by our worst. And if you get caught breaking a rule, that means *you.*" He glared at them, then shrugged. "Besides, if you *do* get caught, that means you weren't cunning enough. This is the House of the Cunning, and you're all expected to *act like it*."

"And lastly, rule number three," Gemma said. "Do not, under any circumstances, meet the Headmaster's eyes. He is a skilled legilimens, and known to be indiscriminate about it. If you desire training in occlumency, speak to Professor Snape. Discretely. And don't let on that you know, either; the Headmaster thinks it's a secret still."

Harry and Hermione looked at each other, confused. What were legilimency and occlumency, anyway? But before either of them could ask, the wall opened again and the sallow-skinned professor with stringy dark hair, whom Harry had seen speaking with Prof. Quirrell at the feast, stepped through.

"Professor Snape, sir," Fenwick said, straightening to attention. "All present and accounted for."

"So I see, Mr. Runcorn," Prof. Snape said. He had a deep voice, and there was something about it that commanded attention without needing to shout for it. He sounded like the low rumble of a large predator, Harry thought with concern. He hoped he would never be on the receiving end of that rumble, or the frankly unnerving black-eyed stare - like looking into an abyss - but those hopes were immediately dashed as Prof. Snape's eyes locked on him and *narrowed.*

To Harry's immediate relief and growing trepidation, Snape did not address him directly. But there was a threat to his rumble now; as if he might start growling at any moment.

"You are all now members of Slytherin House," he said. "And as such, you will be expected to uphold a certain standard of behavior." The glare focused on Ron, who paled. "You will follow the school rules to the *letter.* If you are caught breaking the rules," he paused, glaring at each of them in turn, "you will be punished most harshly."

He began to pace, making the resemblance to a large jungle cat even stronger. "As many of you are aware, we in Slytherin are subject to... certain prejudices. The rest of the school - of the *world* - will take any excuse to inflict upon you what they imagine you deserve for having the gall to be sorted into the House of the Serpent. *Do not give them an excuse.*"

He looked at them in expectation. Behind him, Gemma mouthed "yes, sir." They followed suit, loudly echoing her. Ron's voice cracked.

Snape nodded. "As first years," he continued, "you will not yet know your way around the castle. This is unacceptable. You will henceforth be assigned Miss Fawley as your primary prefect. You will meet with her as a group before each class, and she will *ensure* you all arrive without undue mishap."

Gemma grinned devilishly behind him.

"And on that note. Regarding the forbidden third-floor corridor, the Headmaster was not jesting. For... reasons unfit to share with children, the Headmaster has been obliged to safeguard certain of an associate's possessions. You will *not* go near those safeguards, or there will be more than one painful death to be concerned with. Is that clear?"

Gemma nodded behind him.

"Yes, sir!" They all chorused.

Snape nodded. "The last item of business, then. As I call your name, you will step forward to receive your course schedule for the year. Bulstrode, Millicent!"

Students came up as they were called, and Snape spoke with each of them quietly for a moment before handing them a sheet of parchment. Hermione marched up as if she'd done it every day of her life, and Snape nodded approvingly. Draco walked up as if he hadn't a care in the world, and Snape actually seemed to be restraining a smile.

Harry approached carefully, as if approaching a large dog which may or may not bite. Snape stared at him, face a blank mask. "Potter," he said. "You surprise me. I would have expected more of your father in you."

"With respect, sir," Harry replied, "I never knew my father. Or my mother. My aunt refuses to speak of them."

Snape's eyes widened at that. "Your aunt? The old fool..." He trailed off. "I knew your mother, Potter, in school. You have her eyes. I would hope you have her mind as well."

Harry smiled nervously. "I suppose we'll find out, sir. Um, sir?"

Snape raised an eyebrow.

"Would you tell me about her sometime? My mother, I mean. Only, I don't know anything about my parents except that they died when I was a baby. And that I have my father's hair and my mother's eyes."

Snape's brow furrowed. "Perhaps, Potter. Perhaps." He handed Harry his schedule, and gestured him away.

Ron was next. Harry gave him a reassuring pat on the shoulder as they passed each other. Ron returned to his seat a minute later with a quizzical look on his face, but he was no longer as pale.

"Zabini, Blaise" returned to his seat and Snape dismissed them, turning with a billow of his black cloak and stalking out the door.

Fenwick clapped his hands. "Right, then! Dorms are down that hall, branched by year; your room has your name on the door. You keep the same room all seven years, so take good care of it. Meet Fawley here by 0800 tomorrow. Sweet dreams, little snakes!"

They all trooped down the hallway, finding the first-year corridor about halfway down. Draco, Harry, and Ron were all right next to each other, with Hermione across the way from Harry. Tracy Davis, a petite brunette with keen blue eyes sparkling with mischief, was on one side of her, and Daphne Greengrass, a willowy blonde with ice-blue eyes, was on the other.

Ron was delighted to have his own room, as was Harry. Ron could be heard exclaiming "bloody hell!" even with his door closed. Harry couldn't blame him, though. The rooms were downright luxurious, especially after the cupboard. The floor was black marbled tile, with a fireplace on the right and a large four-poster bed on the left. To the right of the doorway was a wardrobe, of inlaid ebony. The bed had shelves in the headboard, a gas-lamp fixture in the wall above, and a small cabinet on either side, and his trunk was at the foot. Against the far wall was a roll-top desk, with a gas lamp and moss-green leather-upholstered chair. A door was nestled in the left corner, presumably leading to a bathroom. The fireplace had another chair settled before it, atop a thick silver plush rug.

But what really caught the eye was the ceiling. Like the Great Hall, it appeared to have been enchanted. But where the Great Hall showed the sky, *this* ceiling looked into the Lake. A dim greenish glow suffused everything, and Harry could just make out shadows darting here and there through the gloom.

Harry called a good-night to his house-mates and settled in. For the first time in his life, he felt like he was *home.*
