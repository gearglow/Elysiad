# Year 1 - Ch. 4 - A Rite of Passage

Professor McGonagall dropped Harry off at Number 4, Privet Drive. Hagrid walked Harry to the door, and when Uncle Vernon opened it any bile he was about to spout was choked back at the sight of him.

"Inside, boy," he grit out instead.

"'Bye, Hagrid," Harry said, giving the large man a hug, "and thanks for everything!"

"Yer welcome, Harry. I'll see ye at Hogwarts, then."

"Can't wait! 'Bye, Professor McGonagall!"

Harry stepped inside, and Uncle Vernon promptly slammed the door. Harry went upstairs to sort his purchases, deciding he'd better pack his trunk ahead of time and keep it on his person, shrunk to pocket size, so as to avoid the Dursleys getting their hands on any of it. The satchel also went in the trunk, since it couldn't shrink itself.

The remainder of the summer was spent reading the many books he'd purchased, and writing back and forth with Hermione. They'd tried a phone call once, about a week after the Diagon Alley trip, but Uncle Vernon said something about Harry "stopping him dialing into the office" and banned him from the phone.

As August 31st arrived, Harry decided he'd better talk to his uncle about getting to King's Cross the next day. The Dursleys had all avoided and ignored Harry since Hagrid had turned up, and Dudley wouldn't even stay in the same room as him, so Harry was hopeful. He made his way downstairs and into the living room, where Uncle Vernon was watching TV. Dudley screamed and ran from the room, but Uncle Vernon didn't so much as blink.

"Er - Uncle Vernon?"

Uncle Vernon grunted.

"Er - I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to go to Hogwarts."

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

"Could you give me a lift, please?"

Another grunt.

"Thank you."

He was about to return to his room when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.

"Funny way to get to a magical school, the train. Magic carpets all worn through, have they?"

Harry didn't say anything. He knew from his reading that magic carpets were illegal in Britain, but he didn't think Uncle Vernon would appreciate his saying so.

"Where is this school, anyway?"

"Scotland, somewhere," Harry answered. He'd found it in *Hogwarts, A History*, which had been a very engrossing read. He and Hermione had been writing back and forth about it rather a lot; it seemed to be her favourite book just now.

Uncle Vernon grunted yet again, and said, "Right. You're lucky we're going up to London anyway, or we wouldn't bother."

"Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to maintain civility.

"Taking Dudley to the surgeon," growled Uncle Vernon. "Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he starts school."

Harry wisely said nothing and retreated back to his room.

The next morning, Harry woke before the sun, too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. As his trunk was already packed, with his wand inside his book-bag and his book-bag in the trunk, he had only to dress - regulation black slacks and white Oxford button-down, and his new dragon-hide chukka boots - and put his shrunken trunk in his pocket. In a fit of boredom and generosity - mostly boredom - he headed down to the kitchen to make breakfast for the house.

They ate in silence.

When they finished, and the dishes dealt with, Uncle Vernon led the way to the car. Harry had Hedwig in one hand, but the other was empty, and Uncle Vernon looked confusedly around for other luggage.

"All packed, then, boy?" He growled. "You best not have forgotten anything. We won't have you writing us with those ruddy owls to send your socks or what-have-you."

"No Uncle Vernon, I've not forgotten anything."

"Ruddy wizards," Uncle Vernon grumbled. "Well, get in then, boy, we haven't got all day. And mind that blasted owl!"

And they were off.

They reached King's Cross around 10:30, and Uncle Vernon dropped Harry at the curb. He made his way inside, then pulled his ticket from his pocket. *Platform 9 ^3/4^*, it said. He made his way towards Platform 9, and there next to it was...

Platform 10.

Odd.

There was a brick barrier between the two platforms, and he leaned up against it to study his ticket again. Or at least he tried to. Instead, he fell through the barrier as if it wasn't there at all, and when he picked himself up -- Hedwig squawking angrily in her cage where he'd dropped her -- he saw an old-fashioned steam locomotive. It was painted a bright fire-truck red, with 'Hogwarts Express' in gold along the side. The platform itself was packed with people, most in robes.

Harry had just managed to regain his feet and step away from the barrier when a large red-headed family burst through after him, one after the other, all laden with luggage trolleys.

The first one through was rather snobbish-looking, with a wiry build, and had a badge on his robes that said *Prefect.* He looked about 15. He was promptly followed by a pair of identical twins, with a stockier build and mischievous grins. They looked about 13. Next was a boy who looked to be about Harry's age, with a rat peeking out of his pocket, and a small girl (maybe 9 or 10, Harry guessed, not much younger than he was) holding the hand of what could only be her mother. The woman was broad, in a pleasant, rounded sort of way, and Harry thought that she likely would've made a better aunt than Petunia. They all made straight for the train, chattering loudly.

Harry followed, and hoped that following their lead wouldn't get him into too much trouble. With those twins, though, he wasn't so sure.

"Please, Mum, can't I go too?" The girl was saying as Harry approached.

"Ginny, dear, you're too young still," her mother replied.

"It's only a year, Gin," the boy with the rat said. "You'll be joining us before you know it. And I'll write you every week."

"Thanks, Ron," Ginny replied, looking only slightly mollified.

"And we'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat," the twins chimed in, in unison. This got a giggle from their sister.

Their mother glared. "You'll do no such thing! Now, get on the train." She bent to scrub at Ron's nose with a handkerchief. "Ron, write as soon as you're sorted. Fred, George, look after your brother. Percy, dear, keep an eye on your brothers."

"Yes, Mum," they all chorused. She hugged each of them as they boarded the train, with Fred and George bringing up the rear after handing up everyone's trunks.

As Ginny and her mother stepped back, Harry took the opportunity to board the train. His eyes met the girl's and they both smiled, blushed, and looked away before continuing on.

Distracted by Ginny, Harry bumped into the red-headed boy with the rat.

"Oof! Sorry," Harry said.

"No harm done," the boy replied. He stuck out a hand to shake. "I'm Ron, Ron Weasley."

Harry shook hands. "Harry, Harry Potter."

Ron's eyes bulged. "Harry Potter! Are you really?"

"So they tell me," Harry quipped.

"Er, okay," Ron stammered. "Shall we find a compartment, then?"

"Sure," Harry replied. Making friends seemed to be much easier without Dudley around.

They made their way down the train, until a few cars later Harry spotted a familiar head of bushy brown hair in an otherwise empty compartment.

"Hermione!" Harry cheered as he slid open the door.

Hermione looked up from a book she'd been reading (*Hogwarts, A History*, Harry noticed) and smiled broadly. "Harry!" She jumped up and wrapped him in a bone-crushing hug, her robes swirling around them. Harry let out a strained squeak, and Hermione released him with a sheepish grin. "How was your summer? Did you find the platform okay? That barrier was quite the trick, wasn't it? Who's your friend?"

Ron stood in the doorway, gobsmacked at the girl's torrent of words.

"This is Ron Weasley." Harry answered for him. "May we join you?"

"Of course!" Hermione replied, stepping back to let them enter.

Together, they got Ron's trunk settled in the overhead rack next to Hermione's. She looked around in confusion. "Where's your trunk, Harry?"

"In my pocket," he replied. "It's got a shrinking enchantment. Much easier to deal with." He hefted Hedwig's cage. "I've only got to worry about Hedwig, here." He set the cage on the overhead rack. Hedwig nestled her beak under a wing and went to sleep.

Ron patted the pocket his rat was in and looked nervous.

Hermione settled back into her seat, and Harry and Ron took the seat across from her.

"So, anything new from Hogwarts, A History?" Harry asked, gesturing to the book in her lap.

"The library is one of the most extensive in all of Britain!" Hermione's eyes gleamed. "And just think, we can visit it whenever we want!"

Harry grinned at his book-obsessed friend, but Ron looked vaguely horrified.

"I wonder if wizards use the Dewey Decimal System?" Harry mused.

They bantered back and forth for awhile as the train got under way, with Ron slowly getting used to Hermione's exuberance, until a knock sounded at their compartment door. Hermione answered it to find a chubby, round-faced boy with brown hair and a nervous smile. "Hullo," the boy said shyly. "You lot wouldn't have happened to see a toad, have you? Only, mine's escaped."

"No, unfortunately we haven't," answered Hermione. "Would you like some help searching?"

The boy nodded with a sheepish smile. "Yes, please. I'm Neville, by the way. Neville Longbottom."

"I'm Hermione, and this is Harry and Ron," Hermione gestured at them. Neville waved. "Let's split up," she continued. "Harry, you and Ron head toward the front of the train, and Neville and I will head to the back."

Harry and Ron agreed, and Hermione swept out with a billow of her robes, Neville in tow.

"Hey, Ron," Harry said. "Mind if I change first? I feel out of place without robes."

Ron nodded, and helped Harry draw the shutters. "Sure, mate. I may as well too."

They got Ron's trunk down again so he could retrieve his Hogwarts robes, then replaced it. Harry then drew his own trunk from his pocket and tapped a rune on the lid. It grew to full size, and Harry rummaged around a bit before emerging with his robes and his wand. They changed quickly. Harry shrank and pocketed his trunk again, and they left Hedwig asleep in her cage with the other two trunks as they made their way up the train.

They were nearly to the first car, without any luck, when they came across Malfoy sitting in a compartment with two larger boys and a girl with black hair, icy blue eyes, and a turned-up button nose. Harry rather uncharitably thought it made her look like a pug, though her expression didn't exactly help.

"Yes?" Malfoy looked up as Harry opened the compartment door.

"Hi," Harry replied. "Er, Malfoy, right? Have any of you seen a toad? A friend lost his."

The girl wrinkled her nose at mention of a toad. Malfoy ignored her and stood. "No, no toads here. And yes, it's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy." He offered his hand to shake.

"Harry Potter," Harry replied, shaking the offered hand. "Didn't we meet in Madam Malkin's a month ago?"

"We did," Draco replied. "I thought I recognized you. You have very distinctive eyes."

Harry found himself blushing slightly. Draco smirked.

"This toad," Draco continued. "It wouldn't happen to be Longbottom's toad, would it?"

Harry nodded.

"Typical," Draco said. "He never was very good at keeping track of things. I overheard that he lost it on the platform too. Listen, the prefects' compartment is just up the train. One of them should be able to summon the toad for you."

"Though why anyone would want to find a toad is beyond me," the pug-faced girl interjected. "If it were mine I would have 'lost' it the first chance I got."

"They were the height of fashion a few decades back," Draco retorted. "You'd probably have kept one in a little pouch on your cloak, Pansy."

Pansy shuddered.

"Excuse my manners, Potter. This is Pansy Parkinson, Vincent Crabbe, and Gregory Goyle." He gestured at the compartment's occupants. "And who's your companion there? A Weasley, I assume, from the hair."

Ron bristled in the doorway. "What about my hair?"

Draco smirked again. "Well, it's... distinctive."

Ron glared. "You-!"

Harry placed a hand on his shoulder. "Easy, Ron. Let's just go."

Ron stomped off. Harry nodded at Draco and turned to follow.

"Be seeing you, Potter!" Draco called out as he went. "Mind that temper of Weasley's!"

Ron was fuming as Harry caught up. "That Malfoy! He's such a prat! Just like his father. Just because we're not rich like he is -"

Harry cut Ron off. "You know his father?"

Ron nodded. "I know of him. My father works for the Ministry, and Malfoy's father is always in and out, swanning about the place as if he owns it. They don't get along."

Harry just nodded.

"Anyway," Ron continued, "this is the prefects' compartment. I bet we can get my brother Percy to summon Neville's toad for us."

Ron knocked on the compartment door, then opened it and stuck his head in. "Hey Percy, could you do us a favour?"

"Ronald," a boy who looked much like an older and fussier Ron replied. "Not causing trouble already, I hope?"

"No, Perce. Neville Longbottom's lost his toad, and we - that is, Harry and I" - he gestured at Harry behind him - "were helping look for it. We were hoping you could summon it for us."

"Well, that's admirable of you, helping a fellow student," Percy replied. "Very mature of you, Ron."

Ron made a face.

Percy stood, stepped past Ron into the corridor and, with a wave of his wand, intoned, "*accio* Neville's toad." A few seconds later, a toad came flying down the corridor, chased by Neville and Hermione. Harry deftly caught the toad as they ran up, panting.

"You have the worst timing!" Hermione huffed. "We'd just found Trevor and were on our way back to the compartment, and then suddenly he goes flying out of Neville's pocket and down the train!"

Harry smiled nervously, handing the toad carefully back to Neville. "Erm... oops?"

Ron goggled. "Oops nothing. That was a bloody amazing catch, Harry!"

"Language, Ron," Percy scolded. "But you're right. It was indeed an impressive catch, Harry. You might want to try out for quidditch next year; you'd be an asset to the team."

"Thanks, Percy," Harry smiled bashfully. "I'd have to learn what quidditch actually *is* first, though."

Ron's eyes widened at that. "Excuse us, Percy," he exclaimed, and dragged Harry back to their compartment. Hermione heaved a sigh, smiled sheepishly at Percy, and followed, tugging Neville along with her.

"Thanks!" He called back to Percy as he was dragged off.

Percy just nodded and returned to his compartment.
