# Year 4 - Endgame - A Grave Mistake
"*Reenervate*."

Harry opened his eyes as the smoke cleared. A tall humanoid figure stood, moving with lithe and serpentine grace. The figure was androgynous, and more so once Wormtail had draped it in a flowing black robe. It glided up to where Harry was tied to a headstone and leaned in with a grin.

It was a handsome face, Harry thought, even with the glowing red eyes. No hair anywhere, not even eyelashes, and yet the effect was more striking than repulsive. A tracery of lines crisscrossed the figure's scalp, though in the moonlight Harry couldn't tell if they were scars, tattoos, or something else.

"Harry Potter," Voldemort said, "we meet in the flesh at last."

"Voldemort," Harry replied, voice shaking with both fear and anger.

"I will never be rid of that ridiculous name, will I?" Voldemort straightened with an eye-roll and continued, "Please, call me V. The name 'Voldemort' was a folly of youth, one which it seems will haunt me forever. I am not that child any longer, just as Albus Dumbledore is no longer Grindelwald's consort."

Harry shook his head in confusion. "He what?"

"First things first, Harry." V began pacing, twirling vis wand in vis fingers. "I regret that such - abrupt - measures were necessary, but I'm glad to be able to speak with you away from Albus' influence. And I must thank you; without your blood, my so-called resurrection would have failed entirely. Now," ve turned, "I shall let you loose, but please don't do anything rash. I merely wish to speak with you, and tell you what really happened the night your parents died."

"I know what happened," Harry shouted. "Dumbledore told me you killed them, then tried to kill me!"

"No, Harry," V said, "I did not. Oh, I was there," ve continued, as Harry drew breath to shout again. "I was there to consult with your mother, on the advice of one Severus Snape. Your father, James, took umbrage and attacked me. In the ensuing melee, he managed to strike one of my implants - experimental, you understand - and destabilize it. It exploded, killing your parents and disintegrating my body. Debris from the explosion gave you that scar, not the killing curse. The odd mental connection between us, which I'm sure you've noticed, is because the explosion was laced with my own magic, as it came from within me."

"How did you survive, then?" Harry asked, shocked, and no longer straining against his bonds.

"Another of my experimental implants, one which provides an anchor for my soul and an imprint of my memories. It was charmed to be impervious to most kinds of damage. Dumbledore would call it a horcrux, though it's nothing so crude or abhorrent as that. Soul magics are a complicated field, and one most of the magical world regards as Dark; that's a rant for another time, however. The point is, your mother, Lily, had been researching soul and blood magics - I do not know why - and came across something important. She mentioned it to Severus, who had been something of a research partner, and he mentioned it to me."

V stopped pacing, noticing that Harry had calmed down. "Now, young Harry, how about we continue this discussion in a more civilized manner? Peter, please bring the Cask and the extra vial."

Harry nodded, and V waved vis wand, vanishing Harry's bonds. Wormtail shrank something and put it in his pocket.

V held up Harry's wand and waved vis own wand over it in a complex pattern, muttering in a language Harry didn't recognize. "I've removed the trace from your wand. Trust no-one until we've had a chance to talk further. You're not safe at Hogwarts."

"You don't say," Harry retorted faintly. Wormtail let out a snort. V handed Harry his wand back. "A gesture of good faith."

Wormtail spoke up. "V, time is short. Perhaps alternative arrangements are in order?" He pulled out a compact clamshell mirror and handed it to V.

"So it is, Peter, so it is," V agreed. "Harry, you must have many questions, and I shall answer them, but not now. You must return to Hogwarts. This," V held up the mirror, "is a communication device not unlike those I'm told your father and his friends used. Simply say 'V' and we will be able to speak face-to-face. When you are able, use this and we shall continue our discussion. Please exercise discretion; I suggest the Room of Requirement or Salazar's Chamber."

Harry accepted the mirror, slipping it into the mokeskin pouch Hagrid had given him for Christmas, and the trio made their way over to where the Triwizard Cup lay.

"The portkey will return you to whence you came. Safe travels, Harry, and thank you," V said.

Harry could only nod; his head was spinning a bit from all the new information he'd just received. He picked up the Cup, and the world dissolved with that familiar navel-hooking feeling.
