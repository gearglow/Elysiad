# Year 1, Chapter 7 - Flyaways

Morning came swiftly, in a glow of sunlight through the Lake's emerald waters. Harry blinked slowly awake, fumbling for his glasses and finding a book next to them on the headboard. It was a slim volume bound in Slytherin-green, with the title "Slytherin Student Handbook" in silver.

*That's helpful,* Harry thought, finally finding his glasses. He sat up and flipped through the volume. Aside from the school and house rules, there was a section containing simple charms for telling the time, setting alarms, personal grooming and cleaning, and other such mundanities, with instructions and ratings by year. There was also a section at the back with a list of the school's staff and faculty, with office hours and locations, and right at the back a little pocket flap labeled "Schedule."

Harry tried the spell to tell time. "*Tempus,*" he intoned, and glowing numbers appeared at the tip of his wand. It was early still, barely 0600, but the excitement of successfully doing magic was enough to ensure he wasn't going back to sleep any time soon.

Deciding he may as well shower, he wandered over to the door next to the desk. As expected, it led to a small but well-appointed bathroom in the same black marble, with a spacious counter, loo, and a claw-foot bathtub with several spouts along one side. A shower-head stood up from one end, with a ceiling-hung curtain tied to it in a neat bundle.

A toothbrush, washcloth, and towel were resting neatly on the counter, next to two bars of soap and a collection of bottles which turned out to be toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, and something called Sleekeazy's. A steel comb leaned against this bottle, and as it caught Harry's eye the mirror spoke up. "You'll need it, deary."

Harry yelped, backing up and tripping over the edge of the tub. It was dry, thankfully, but he still found himself sprawled painfully in the bottom.

"The mirror talks!?" he asked incredulously.

"Of course we do!" the mirror replied. "What good is a mirror that lets you wander about at less than your best?"

Harry shook his head. *Of course,* he thought. *This* is *Slytherin House. Gotta make sure we all look the part.*

He clambered up, gathered the shower supplies, and clambered back into the tub, drawing the curtain before undressing and throwing his nightclothes into a pile by the door. The many taps turned out to all be various bubbles; some were thick and frothy, some skimmed lightly above the water and popped with a delicate *ping.* There was even one that left his finger shimmery when he dipped it in. Finally he found the plain hot water, the tap nearest the shower-head, and washed quickly.

The bath-towel turned out to be both fluffy and enormous, reaching nearly to the floor even when Harry wrapped it around himself just under his shoulders. It was warm, too, as were the tiles, which Harry had not noticed before but now appreciated immensely.

The mirror had not fogged over, or had cleared itself magically; Harry couldn't tell which, but found it disconcerting nonetheless. He shrugged, hoping the mirror would keep its commentary to itself, and got on with it.

When everything else was finished, Harry picked up the bottle of Sleekeazy's. "Massage a drop or two into freshly-washed hair while still damp, and style as desired," he read. Emptying some into his hand, he found a clear, creamy-feeling fluid, which he dutifully rubbed into his hair before combing it out with the steel comb. His hair was long and thick, and he found himself grateful for a comb whose teeth wouldn't easily break off. The Sleekeazy's really was magic, though, as there were no knots and his hair stayed where he combed it, mostly. There were waves which just would not go away, but at least they looked intentional this time, instead of his usual bird's nest.

"How lovely," the mirror commented. Harry snorted; his hair had poofed up a bit as it dried, and he now had a rather wild shock of black framing his face. *I look like Joan Jett,* he thought. *At least it's in fashion?* With another shrug, he left to get dressed.

With the full Hogwarts uniform, especially the Slytherin-green trim and his dragon-hide chukka boots, Harry decided that he rather liked his hair after all. The green did *something* that somehow made it all work, though he felt his glasses rather clashed. *Maybe I should get contacts,* he thought as he gathered his supplies for the day. *Or can magic fix my eyes? I bet Draco would know.* Resolving to ask him, Harry finally left his dorm, nearly running straight into Hermione, who was just leaving her own.

"Good morning, Harry," she said, then stared. "Wh-what happened to your hair?" She asked, expression indecipherable.

Harry smiled hesitantly. "This is what Sleakeazy's does, apparently. I found a bottle on my bathroom counter. D'you like it? I thought it was a bit much at first, but it's growing on me," he replied in a nervous rush.

Hermione grinned. "Well of course it's growing on you. You *are* a mammal, after all." She laughed at Harry's ensuing grimace. "Yes, I think I rather do like it. You look like a rock star, almost."

"Oh? Which one?" Harry asked, leading the way down the hall.

"Joan Jett," Hermione answered with a giggle. Harry sighed.

They entered the common room and were waved over to a cluster of seats near one of the small fireplaces scattered around the room, where Gemma waited. She had a clipboard and quill in hand, and checked their names off as they sat.

"'Morning, firsties," she greeted. "Potter, what's up with your hair?"

"I tried Sleakeazy's," he answered as Hermione failed to contain another giggle.

Gemma smirked. "How much did you use? Only a drop, I bet."

Harry shook his head. "No, I used a good-sized dollop."

Gemma raised an eyebrow. "You'd think it'd work better on your hair, of all people, given that it was your grandfather who invented it," she laughed. "Most people only need two drops."

Just then, Draco sauntered up, hair slicked back in a blond cascade nearly to his shoulders. "Nice mane, Harry," he teased. "Planning on joining the Weird Sisters?"

"Not that I know of," Harry replied. "Who're they?"

"They're a band," Draco answered. "Wizard rock, I think you'd call it."

"See!" Hermione cried. "I *told* you you look like a rock star!"

Harry rolled his eyes. "Not with these glasses. Hey Draco, can magic do anything about that? Contacts or something, or even fix my sight entirely?"

Draco thought for a moment. "Well, maybe. I don't know about fixing your eyes; you'd want to ask in the hospital wing about that. But I think all you really need is different frames." He turned to Gemma. "Prefect Fawley, could you perhaps assist my friend here with his rather pressing wardrobe crisis?"

Gemma grinned and stood, cracking her knuckles. "It won't be permanent, but I believe I can assist our Mr. Potter in making a rather more favorable first impression." She drew her wand, muttering a spell under her breath, and tapped Harry's glasses. They shifted and twisted and flowed until they settled into thick black frames, almost goggle-esque.

"Huh." Draco said.

"'Huh' what?" Harry demanded.

"'Huh' as in, those *should* be hideous, Harry," Draco retorted. "But somehow they work, and I can't seem to wrap my head around it quite yet."

"You look like Elton John, Harry," Hermione said. "Or the glasses remind me of him, anyway. Yours aren't that outrageous, but they kind of have the same effect."

The rest of the first years began trickling in, starting with Blaise Zabini, who nearly walked into a chair upon seeing Harry's new look. Pansy actually did, causing Tracy Davis to giggle.

"Did you want his autograph, Pans?" She asked, through her mirth.

Pansy glared, and was about to offer a no doubt scathing retort, when Ron finally walked in.

"Bloody hell, Harry!" He exclaimed. "Why didn't you tell me you were in a band?"

"Language, Weasley!" Gemma admonished, before exploding with giggles.

Hermione and Draco collapsed against each other in hysterics.

------

Eventually, they all followed Gemma up to breakfast in the Great Hall, Hermione and Draco flanking Harry with mock-stern expressions. Because Ron had arrived so late, the entire school was already present.

The Gryffindor table had the most extreme reactions. Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil squealed, Neville gasped, and the Weasley twins actually stood and started chanting, "Pot-ter! Pot-ter!"

Harry glanced toward the head table and caught Snape's eye. He shrugged apologetically and rolled his eyes with a grimace; Snape just scowled, shook his head, and went back to his eggs.

Eventually the gaggle of giggling firsties reached their seats at the Slytherin table.

"I really hope this doesn't keep happening," Harry said morosely. "I'm too young to be a rock star."

This set off a fresh wave of giggles, which didn't abate until Hermione gasped suddenly and pointed at the ceiling. Hundreds of owls were streaming in through small openings under the eaves, bearing letters and packages. One particularly bedraggled owl collapsed in Ron's lap.

"Oh, it's Errol," he told them, "my family's owl. What's this, then?" His face paled and his eyes widened, as the red envelope Errol bore began to smoke ominously.

"What is it, Ron?" Hermione asked.

"It's a howler!" Tracy replied, eyes wide with fear. "Better open it, Ron, waiting'll just make it worse."

"Or make a run for it," Blaise said. "Take it out to a spare classroom or some such; spare the rest of us your dignity."

Ron blanched and nodded. "Right, wish me luck!" He stood and bolted out of the Great Hall, the letter clutched white-knuckled and leaving a trail of smoke as he fled.

Even with the doors shut, though, they could all hear a muffled voice shouting, "RONALD BILIUS WEASLEY! I NEVER! WHERE DID I GO WRONG -" before suddenly cutting off.

"Well that was terrifying," Harry commented.

Draco let out a sigh of relief. "Poor Weasley. His mum's howlers are legendary. She sent one to the Wizengamot once; my father says Mr. Weasley got denied a raise because of it. Good call, Zabini."

------

That night, in the common room, Ron could be heard complaining loudly about how his ears were still ringing. Harry assumed it was so loudly because Ron couldn't hear properly, but Draco seemed to think that was just how Ron was. "If *my* mum were that loud," Harry remarked, "I suppose I'd probably be like that too, just to be heard at all."

Draco snorted. "I imagine that's why Arthur Weasley is as soft-spoken as he is. He's given up."

Ron scowled at that. "You leave my da out of this, Malfoy!"

"Out of what, Weasley?" Draco rolled his eyes. "All I said was that he's wise enough to choose his battles. You, on the other hand, seem to take after your mother."

Ron growled. "And what's *that* supposed to mean?"

"It *means,*" Draco growled right back, "that you are deficient in both subtlety and tact. For all our sakes, reign in that temper of yours."

"You calling my mum deficient!?"

"If the howler fits!"

Ron made to leap at Draco, fists raised, but Hermione stuck out a foot as he passed and Ron wound up sprawled at Draco's feet. Draco took a hasty step back.

"Ron, are you a Slytherin or not? Show some decorum." Hermione said sternly. "If you start brawling I'll go fetch Professor Snape."

Draco nodded his thanks to her, and reached down to help Ron to his feet. "Weasley, do you know why our families don't get along?"

Ron ignored Draco's outstretched hand and stood, fists clenched at his sides. "Because your da insulted my mum to my da's face!"

Draco sighed. "No, actually, he didn't. Your mother sent a howler to the entire Wizengamot and made your whole family a laughingstock. Your father even lost a raise because of it. My father merely told yours what was being said behind his back, and your mum decided to curse the messenger. And clearly she hasn't learned from the experience."

"That howler *was* pretty embarrassing, Ron," Hermione commented. "For everyone."

"You're a Slytherin," Draco continued. "Like it or not. I'm not trying to insult you. I'm trying to help you, and maybe save myself some grief along the way. Because the way you go off right now, it's not just embarrassing for you. It makes us *all* look bad."

A chorus of agreement sounded from the other students, who had given up pretending to ignore the altercation. Ron looked around, jaw clenched and face red. 

Harry laid a hand on his shoulder, trying to comfort him. "Ron," he started. "Breathe. We're your friends."

"Or at least trying to be," Draco grumbled. "Look, Weasley, I'm not my father, and you aren't yours. Can you at least hate me on my own merits, not because of what our parents think of each other?"

Harry felt Ron's shoulder slump. "Fine," he sighed. "Mum's temper *is* pretty mental. Not what I want to be known for."

"Truce, then?" Draco asked, tentatively.

Ron nodded, then stuck out his hand. "Truce."

Draco smiled and shook his hand.

------

By the next day, Gemma's transfiguration on his glasses had faded, and Harry had decided to forgo the Sleekeazy's. It brought him too much attention, and he was getting enough of that as it was already. Everywhere he went, people stared and whispered and tried to get a glimpse of his scar.

Harry was very glad Gemma was there to guide them. She kept the worst of the gawkers at bay, and knew the castle's idiosyncrasies by heart. The castle itself was a veritable maze, with moving staircases; trick steps that looked like they were there but weren't; doors that opened to different places depending on the phase of the moon; secret passages, only some of which had a trick to using them and the others where the only trick was finding them; and, of course, Peeves the poltergeist, who may as well have been chaos incarnate. The Weasley twins got on swimmingly with him; for anyone else, running into him when you were late meant that you might as well skive off, as by the time he was done with you your class would be over anyway.

And then there were the classes themselves. Astronomy, with the Ravenclaws, took place late at night on Wednesdays, at the top of the tallest tower, where Prof. Aurora Sinistra, a tall, dark witch with long dark hair, taught them how to identify various celestial bodies and their significance. They didn't make it back to the dungeons until half past one in the morning.

Herbology took place in the greenhouses thrice a week with the Gryffindors; Prof. Pomona Sprout, a sturdy witch with close-cropped curly grey hair and a kind smile, who was also Hufflepuff's head of house, taught them all about the strange plants and fungi, and their uses. Neville was visibly in his element, and even beat Hermione to answering some of Prof. Sprout's questions.

Charms was twice a week, with the Hufflepuffs, and Prof. Filius Flitwick, Ravenclaw's head of house. Prof. Flitwick was the diminutive professor Harry had noticed at the Sorting Feast, and he proved to be both excitable and brilliant. When he came to Harry's name in the roll the first day, he squeaked and fell off the stack of books on which he'd been perched. He promptly regained his feet with a rather impressive flip, yanked a book off the stack, and slammed it down on his desk. It tried to bite him, but he danced back and flicked his wand at it with a cry of "*Incarcero!*"

"Pay attention, class, this is the first spell I'll be teaching you," he said. "But first..." And he continued reading the roll, pointedly ignoring the book struggling against the ropes now binding it closed.

By the end of the period, Harry, Draco, and Hermione had all successfully cast the spell, though it didn't last very long, and Ron had managed to at least get ropes to fly out of his wand, though they wrapped so loosely that Harry was able to simply step out of them. Prof. Flitwick gave them each 5 points for being the only students to cast the spell, and Ron another 2 for working out what he'd done wrong.

Defense Against the Dark Arts was much anticipated, but fell somewhat short of expectations. Prof. Quirrell seemed to know his subject well intellectually, but didn't seem to want to discuss the more "exciting" aspects. Nor would he discuss the purple turban he wore, beyond saying it was a gift from a friend. Furthermore, the classroom was haunted by the lingering smell of garlic, though none was in sight.

History of Magic was also a let-down. By all rights it should have been riveting, as it was taught by a ghost. But the late Prof. Cuthbert Binns, whose entrance through the blackboard made some of the students jump, was so dry and boring that, not 10 minutes in, most of the class was actually snoring. Hermione took notes, and poked the other three with her quill every so often so they wouldn't snore, but even she was looking a bit dazed by the time the class ended.

Transfiguration was the exact opposite. No-one would *dare* fall asleep in Prof. McGonagall's class, especially not after she opened with a very stern lecture.

"Transfiguration is one of the most dangerous magical arts," she said, glaring at them fiercely. "And as such, anyone caught fooling about will be asked to leave and not come back. I do not tolerate hijinks, shenanigans, or horseplay."

She then transfigured her desk into a pig and back again.

Sadly, the rest of the class moved much slower. Prof. McGonagall started them off small, setting them to transfiguring matchsticks into needles. By the time class ended, only Hermione and Draco had managed it. Harry's match had gone silvery, though, so he felt sure he'd manage it soon enough.

Thursday dawned to the anticipation of that afternoon's flying lesson. Ron and Draco, and most of the first-years, chattered excitedly about broomsticks. Ron, it turned out, had been playing quidditch with his brothers in their orchard for years. Draco claimed to have his own quidditch pitch, and also to have narrowly avoided a helicopter once. Ron then claimed to have escaped a flock of muggles on hang-gliders, at which point Harry tuned them out to focus on Hermione, who was nervously flipping through a copy of **Quidditch Through the Ages,* looking for advice on managing a broomstick.

"Breathe, 'Mione, you'll be fine," Harry said, patting her comfortingly on the back. "You're not the only one who hasn't flown before, remember? We'll figure it out together."

Hermione took a long, deep breath, and let it out with a sigh. "You're right, Harry, thanks." She smiled nervously at him.

Harry was trying to get Hermione to eat more than just a piece of toast when Neville wandered over to say good morning.

"Hey, Nev," Harry said. "Excited for flying lessons?"

Neville blanched. "Ehrm... not... really?" he squeaked. "I'm clumsy enough on the ground."

Hermione smiled sympathetically.

"Anyway," Neville continued, "I wanted to ask you something." He paused. "But I forgot what! Oh, I'm forgetting everything today!" He buried his face in his hands, dropping a small glass sphere roughly the size of a lemon. It was filled with red smoke, and Harry snagged it as it fell. The smoke promptly turned white.

"Nice catch, Harry," Draco said. "Oh hey, a Remembrall!"

Neville looked up as Harry handed the orb back to him. "Yeah, my gran sent it to me just a bit ago. She thought I might find it useful because I'm so forgetful. It turns red if you've forgotten something. But the trouble is, I can't remember what I've forgotten!"

"Roghbbes," Ron said around a mouthful of sausage. Hermione smacked his arm. "Sorry," he continued, after swallowing. "Robes, Nev. You're not wearing your robes."

Neville looked down and groaned.

"If you hurry, you'll still have time to grab them before the first class," Draco said.

"Thank, guys," Neville said. "See you this afternoon!" He ran off, Remembrall clutched tightly in hand.

------

After lunch, the Slytherins all trooped out to the grounds, where Madame Hooch was waiting with two rows of brooms laid out on the grass. Madame Hooch was an athletic-looking woman with spiky hair and amber eyes. Harry thought she resembled a hawk. The Gryffindors soon joined them, and they each lined up behind a broom.

Neville managed to grab a spot next to Harry, and across from Pansy. "I remembered what I wanted to ask earlier," He told Harry quietly. "Would you watch my back today? Brooms make me nervous, and I'd feel better knowing someone was looking out for me."

Harry smiled reassuringly. "Of course, Nev," he said.

Madame Hooch started calling out instructions then. "Place your hand above your broom, and say 'up.'"

"UP!" everyone called out. Harry's broom leapt straight into his hand. A few others did too; Draco looked pleased and had an excited grin on his face. Pansy had hers in a grip so tight her knuckles were white.

Others, however, were not so lucky. Hermione's had lifted about a foot and then floated back down. Ron's had nearly smacked him in the face. And Neville's had merely rolled over.

"I reckon they're like horses," Harry said to Neville. "They can probably tell you're skittish."

Hermione, overhearing, repeated "up!" in a much more authoritative tone. Her broom lifted up and settled itself gently into her hand. She smirked.

Neville glanced at Harry nervously, but followed Hermione's lead. "Up!" His voice cracked, but he sounded less scared and more anxious. Regardless, the broom rose swiftly into his hand.

"There you go, Nev!" Harry congratulated him.

Once everyone had their brooms in hand, Madame Hooch called out the next instructions. "Sit upright astride your broom, and grip the handle in both hands. Keep your feet on the ground, please."

They all obeyed, and Madame Hooch began walking up and down the rows, correcting their grip and mount. She nodded at Ron and Harry, made only the slightest correction to Hermione's grip, and swapped Draco's hands around. As she was turning to Pansy, though, Neville let out a yell of terror as his broom flew straight up.

Harry didn't even think; he took off after Neville, with Madame Hooch and the rest of the class shouting after him. Near level with the Astronomy Tower, he finally caught up, just in time to catch Neville before he fell off. He'd just gotten Neville safely settled back in his broom when a shimmering glass sphere, filled with red smoke, fell out of Neville's pocket. Without stopping to think, Harry dived after it. The ground was rushing closer and closer. The Remembrall was just beyond his grasp. Leaning in close over his broom, Harry reached out and snagged the Remembrall at the last possible moment, managing to pull up so close to the ground that his toes skimmed the grass.

He circled around and landed gently, amid dumbstruck silence.

"Here's your Remembrall, Nev," he said, as Neville finally drifted down to earth.

This broke the silence. "Mr. Potter!" Madame Hooch cried. "Never in all my years-! Right, that's it. Class dismissed for today. Mr. Potter, Mr. Longbottom, come with me." She waved her wand, sending all the brooms flying swiftly into a trunk, which then latched and locked itself and followed along behind her as she marched Harry and Neville back to the castle.

Harry sent a worried glance to his friends. "We'll meet you in the Great Hall!" Hermione called. Harry nodded, and then they rounded a corner and entered the castle.

Madame Hooch went first to the hospital wing, insisting that both Neville and Harry be looked over, just in case. Harry took the opportunity to ask about fixing his eyes, which Madame Pomfrey, the mediwitch, informed him was a complex process that would require a week's stay at St. Mungo's, the wizarding hospital.

They left Neville in the entrance hall and proceeded down to the dungeons, where Madame Hooch knocked smartly on a door. It opened to show Snape's dour face and a room full of older students bent over simmering cauldrons.

"What. Is. It." Snape glowered.

"Severus, I've found you a seeker."

Prof. Snape ducked back into the classroom and motioned for one of the students to join him, then they stepped into the hallway. "Potter," Snape growled. "I should have known."

"It wasn't my idea, sir," Harry stammered.

"He's a natural, Severus," Madame Hooch exclaimed. "Saved Longbottom from falling off his broom, and caught his Remembrall after a hundred-foot dive, just above the ground, and stuck the landing to boot. Aidan Lynch couldn't even do it!"

Snape stared at Harry with a considering look.

Harry gaped. "Wait, what? Does this mean I'm not in trouble? And who's Aidan Lynch?"

The other student snorted. "Only the seeker for the Irish National team! You been living under a rock, Potter?"

*No, a staircase,* Harry thought. Snape made a face, as though he'd heard.

"Potter, this is Marcus Flint," Snape said instead. "He's the captain of the Slytherin House quidditch team."

Flint stared at Harry. "We'll have to test you, of course," he said finally. "Try-outs aren't 'til next week."

Madame Hooch cut in again. "If this boy doesn't make the team, it'll be a crime against the sport!"

"Enough, Rolanda," Snape intoned. "Mr. Flint will decide. *If* Mr. Potter proves his mettle, then *perhaps* I will allow the rule concerning first-years and broomsticks to be... forborne."

Madame Hooch nodded.

"Tonight, then," Flint said. "After dinner, we'll put you through your paces."

Harry nodded, and they parted ways.

Madame Hooch left him in the entrance hall, and he headed into the great hall to find Neville, Hermione, Draco, Ron, Vince, Greg, Daphne, Tracy, Millie, and Gemma.

"So?" Ron asked. "How much trouble are you in?"

"Loads," Harry replied, grinning. "Madame Hooch pulled Snape out of class to speak to me."

Gemma's jaw dropped. "And you're not dead or hospitalized?"

"Not yet," Harry said, still grinning.

"You're up to something, Harry!" Hermione admonished. "Spill!"

So Harry recounted the entire conversation, grinning all the while.

Ron noticed afterward that he was still grinning, and that rather manically. "Hey, mate, you okay?" he asked.

Harry let the grin finally fall. "Not really, if I'm honest," he said. "I don't really know what I'm getting into, and it's all because I just *happened* to be the one who got noticed. Why should I be the only one to get this chance? You, or Draco, or Millie, or Tracy, any of you could've been in my place."

They all looked at each other.

"Harry," Draco said hesitantly. "That's not true, actually. I'll be the first to admit that I'm quite good on a broom," he smirked as Ron stuck his tongue out at him, "but Madame Hooch was right. A catch like that, you really only see from the best professional quidditch players."

Ron nodded. "Much as I hate to agree with Malfoy on anything, he's right." Draco stuck his tongue out at Ron. "Are you *sure* that was your first time on a broom?"

Harry nodded.

"Well, then," Ron nodded. "That's that. You were born to fly."

"Would it make you feel better if some of us were there to watch while you and Flint practice tonight?" Hermione asked.

"Y'know, I think it would. Would you really do that for me?" Harry replied.

There were nods all around, except for Neville. "I'd better not," he stammered. "Flint might not like it. House rivalry and all."

"That's alright, Nev," Harry reassured his friend. "Honestly, after everything, I'm just glad that you're not hurt."

Neville smiled.

They all settled in to work on homework, and when dinner began Gemma moved to sit with her friends and Neville returned to the Gryffindor table. Pansy passed by him on her way in, and "accidentally" bumped into him, sending him tumbling into Percy Weasley.

"I saw that, Parkinson," Percy barked, steadying Neville. "5 points from Slytherin."

Pansy made a face and stomped away to the far end of the Slytherin table, where she sat with a couple of older students.

Hermione scowled at her. "What is her problem?"

"As if there were only one," Draco muttered. "Aside from the usual Slytherin/Gryffindor animosity, she's jealous that he's part of 'my' group and she isn't. She's jealous of all of you, really, but Neville's an easier target. She can go after him without breaking Rule 1."

Ron rolled his eyes. "Who'd want to be friends with a bully like her, anyway?"

"Other bullies," Harry and Hermione chorused. They shared a sympathetic look.

"It's more than that," Tracy sang. "She's got a crush on you, Malfoy!" Daphne elbowed her.

Draco looked horrified. "Oh Merlin, why?"

Blaise grinned. "What's wrong, Malfoy? Not your type?"

Draco huffed. "I'm eleven, Zabini. I don't have a type yet. Girls, guys, or otherwise."

"Otherwise, huh?" Blaise looked thoughtful.

Ron looked shocked. "Wait, you can like more than just girls?" His overloaded plate lay forgotten for the moment before him.

Blaise grinned at him and waggled his eyebrows. Ron blushed.

"It's not exactly unheard of in the muggle world," Hermione said. "Especially for musicians. Elton John, Freddie Mercury..."

"It's not unheard of in the magical world, either," Daphne said. "Pureblood society mostly just makes a fuss about producing an heir, and, well, there's magic for that."

Blaise nodded. "That's how I was born, actually. My mum and her girlfriend at the time. She died in the war; Mum wouldn't say on whose side. Mum gets this look, sometimes, when she looks at me, like I'm made of glass or something..." He trailed off. "Anyway. Most of the prejudices about that stuff come from the muggle world. It was one of the things You-Know-Who made a lot of noise about, Mum says."

"That wasn't in any of the books I read on him," Hermione commented.

"A lot of magical society takes it for granted, I guess," Millie chimed in.

Ron thoughtfully returned to his food as the conversation turned to idle chatter.

After dinner, Harry and friends followed Flint and Prof. Snape down to the quidditch pitch. Harry and Flint went over to the supply shed as the others sat in the stands.

"So what do you know about quidditch already?" Flint asked, dragging a large chest out of the shed. He ducked back in as Harry thought, quickly returning with two school brooms.

"Not much," Harry finally replied. "I know that it's wildly popular and played on broomsticks, but that's about it."

"Merlin," Flint muttered, and quickly explained the rules, opening the chest and pointing out the balls as they were mentioned. "So you're tapped for Seeker, yeah? We'll start you off with some basic drills, then. Mount up."

Harry mounted his broom and hovered a few feet up. Flint grabbed a sack from the chest and joined him.

"We'll start you catching first, they're about the same size as the Snitch," Flint said. He opened the sack and drew out a walnut. "You fly off a ways and I'll throw these, and you try and catch them."

Harry didn't miss a single one, which pleased Flint greatly. He could hear his friends cheer every time he caught a walnut, even as Flint threw them harder and further. Eventually, after catching the last one in a steep dive, Flint called him to the ground.

"I can see what Madame Hooch was so excited about," Flint said, with a manic gleam in his eye. "We'll beat that plonker Wood this year for sure! Slytherin'll be a cinch for the Cup with you on the team! Welcome aboard, Potter!"

Flint shook his hand vigorously. His friends cheered louder than ever from the stands. Harry couldn't help but grin.
