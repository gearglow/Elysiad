# Year 5, Chapter X - Shattered Illusions

It was days after the encounter with V in the graveyard in Little Hangleton before Harry was able to find the time, and more importantly, *privacy,* to open the clamshell mirror device V had given him. First there was the aftermath of winning the Triwizard Tournament, the revelation of Barty Crouch, Jr. masquerading as Alastor Moody the entire year, his subsequent suicide before the ministry could question him, and the usual end-of-year chaos. Indeed, it wasn't until Harry and Hermione were safely back home and Dani & Em had been caught up that Harry finally had a moment to himself.

He lay awake late that night, thinking over the last night of the Tournament. He'd told nobody what had happened after he'd touched the Cup, not even Hermione, nor about the trace being lifted from his wand. The conversation he'd had with V that night swam through his mind. Compounding that were the odd thoughts he'd been having all year, and as long as he could remember if he were honest with himself. It all boiled down to one question. "Who am I?"

It wasn't just a dawning awareness of how his life had been manipulated for so long, nor a questioning of almost everything he'd been told about both himself and his parents. No, this was deeper. His thoughts chased around his brain like a kneazle after a rat.

A headline from The Daily Prophet swam to the forefront. "**BOY-WHO-LIVED BECOMING A MAN! WINS TRIWIZARD CUP, OUTWITS ASSASSIN!**" There was much he disliked about that headline; for one, Crouch, Jr. hadn't been an assassin. Kidnapper, debatably, but he'd had no intention of even harming Harry, let alone killing him. But the thing that kept eating at him, more than anything else, was that whole "becoming a man" part. Why was that such a sore point? Didn't most boys *look forward* to becoming men?

He silently thanked Professor Snape for his occlumency tutelage as he chased that feeling down in his mind. Memories began to swarm around him - discomfort at the words 'man,' 'boy,' *'he.'* Neville telling him, that first ride on the Hogwarts Express, "you're a braver *man* than I." Lining up with the girls in kindergarten and getting punished for it. Countless little irritants like that, spanning his entire life.

No. *Her* entire life. Suddenly it all clicked into place.

Harry Potter was a girl.

The next morning, Harry joined her family at the breakfast table. Hermione noticed her pensive expression. "Harry? Did you not sleep well?"

"Not really," Harry replied. "Had some soul-searching to do. Bit of an identity crisis, really."

Hermione raised an eyebrow. "Want to talk about it, brother mine?"

"Sister."

"What?" Hermione asked.

"I'm not your brother. I'm your sister. I'm a girl." Harry shrunk in on herself as she spoke, and Dani and Em looked at each other concernedly.

Hermione just leapt up and engulfed her in a hug. "Oh! That makes so much sense! Do you still want us to call you Harry for now, or have you picked out a new name yet?"

"Let her breathe, Hermione," Em laughed, even as the Granger parents joined in the hug.

Harry smiled at being called *her.* "No, 'Mione, I'm still stuck with 'Harry' for now. Any ideas?"
