A pub in London through which Diagon Alley can be reached.
Located near Charing Cross and Tottenham Court. A Barclay's branch is nearby.

#### Diagon Alley
The epicenter of Magical London.

#### Gringotts
The only bank in Magical Britain. Run by goblins and located in Diagon Alley.

### Elysium
A virtual world inhabited by disembodied souls such as V and Quirrell. Embodied entities can access it via a MUD-like text interface or via magical uplink (only available within Riddle Manor initially).

### Godric's Hollow
The village where James and Lily Potter lived while in hiding under the Fidelius charm. Also where noted figures Albus Dumbledore and Bathilda Bagshot are from.

### Little Hangleton Graveyard
The graveyard in Little Hangleton where V's parents are buried.

### Hogsmeade
The only fully-magical settlement in the UK. Hogwarts is just beyond its boundaries. 3rd-year and older students can visit on certain weekends.

### Hogwarts
England's premier magical school. England's *only* magical school, to be truthful.
#### Hogwarts Great Hall
#### Gryffindor Common Room
#### Slytherin Common Room
#### Ravenclaw Common Room
#### Hufflepuff Common Room
#### Chamber of Secrets
A secret room created by Salazar Slytherin, one of the founders of Hogwarts. Rumored to contain a monster. Accessed by speaking "open" in parseltongue to a faucet in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. Does not appear on the Marauders' Map.

#### The Mirror Chamber
The round, stone chamber at the end of the Trials wherein the Mirror of Erised rests. Within the Mirror is the Philosopher's Stone.

#### Moaning Myrtle's bathroom
A bathroom on the second floor of Hogwarts where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets lies. Haunted by an obnoxious teenage ghost named Moaning Myrtle, so most people avoid it.

#### Room of Requirement
A room on the 7th floor of Hogwarts which can become whatever the occupant requires. Accessible only by pacing back and forth in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy while thinking of what you require. Does not appear on the Marauders' Map.

### #4 Privet Drive
The Dursleys' home in Little Whinging, Surrey. It's the most straight-laced suburban hellscape you could imagine.

### The Burrow
The Weasley family home outside Ottery St. Catchpole, Devon. It's a rambling construction held together mostly by magic, with several stories and even more chimneys. It's situated on a sizable parcel of land containing an apple orchard and a pond, as well as several outbuildings.

### Riddle Manor
The "abandoned" manor house of Tom Riddle, Sr. Located atop a hill in Little Hangleton, with a graveyard at the foot of the hill. There's a Cray supercomputer in the basement, on which the Elysium virtual world is run, among other things. The house is otherwise outfitted as a cutting-edge research lab. It's heavily warded and under the Fidelius, with Lucius Malfoy as the secret-keeper.

### Cabin-On-The-Rock
A desolate, run-down cabin on a lonely rock out in the ocean.

### The Hogwarts Express
A bright red steam engine that, by tradition, carries students to Hogsmeade from King's Cross when term begins, and back again when it ends. Seating is in compartments, not open rows.


## Factions
### The Circle
Precursor to the Death Eaters and Inner Circle. Founded to work towards integration of muggle and wixen societies, with the end goal of giving magic to muggles. Started when Riddle was at Hogwarts; made Riddle a target for Dumbledore's manipulations and later retribution. After Riddle resurfaces in 1971 after disappearing for over a decade, the Circle has fragmented into the Inner Circle, which are loyal friends of Riddle, and the Death Eaters, which are not but claim allegiance in order to perpetrate false-flag operations.

### Death Eaters
A group of pureblood-supremacy zealots.
#### TODO Who is actually in charge of them?
##### Dumbledore
Started to false-flag Riddle's Circle, then took on a life of its own as the Inner Circle went underground.
##### Riddle
Doesn't make sense as the originator. But maybe took control via subterfuge and infiltration by 1981?
##### Someone Else
Who would be the figurehead "Lord Voldemort" then?

### Inner Circle
V's inner circle of co-conspirators.
#### Members

+ Tom Riddle (V)
+ Elysia Le Fey (E)
+ Lily Le Fey (L)
+ Peter Pettigrew (P)
+ Severus Snape (S)
+ Remus Lupin (W)
+ Bellatrix Lestrange (B)
+ Quirinus Quirrell (Q)
+ Lucius Malfoy (M)
+ Narcissa Malfoy (N)
+ Augustus Rookwood (G)
+ Barty Crouch Jr. (U)
+ Rodolphus Lestrange (D)
+ Rabastan Lestrange (T)
+ Regulus Black (R)
+ Evan Rosier (O)

### Friends of Elysium (FoE)
Denizens of the Elysium "MUD" virtual world, which is hosted on a Cray in Riddle Manor. All are Elysia's friends by the end of Year 5. This is the core of the new rebellion after V's return.
Replaces "Dumbledore's Army."

### Gringotts
The goblin nation and banking monopoly.

### Hogwarts
Britain's premier (and only) school of magic.

#### Faculty & Staff

#### Gryffindor
One of the four Hogwarts Houses. Values principles, bravery, and honour. Tend to be flashy and reckless.

#### Slytherin
One of the four Hogwarts Houses. Values cunning, resourcefulness, and ambition. Can be particularly ruthless.

#### Hufflepuff
One of the four Hogwarts Houses. Values loyalty, fairness, and hard work. Can be kind of insular.

#### Ravenclaw
One of the four Hogwarts Houses. Values knowledge, structure, and cleverness. They can be kind of obsessive.

### Marauders
Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. A group of school-friends and notorious pranksters at Hogwarts from 1971-1978. Creators of the Marauders' Map.

### Order of the Phoenix
Dumbledore's group of anti-Death Eaters. Very reactive and not terribly effective.

### Ministry of Magic (MoM)
The government of Magical Britain. Corrupt AF.

## Items
### Merlin Line Bookbag
The bookbag Elysia gets from Packard's before starting Hogwarts. Dragon-hide, with a mokeskin lining, Damascus Steel fittings, and enchantments for durability, featherweight, undetectable extension, and easy retrieval. Matched set with the trunk of the same product line.

### Merlin Line Trunk
The trunk Elysia gets from Packard's before starting Hogwarts. Walnut, with Damascus Steel fittings. Comes with top-of-the-line enchantments for durability, featherweight, undetectable extension, and easy retrieval. The trunk itself has several compartments, including a bookshelf, 30' x 30' room with air refreshing charm, and wardrobe. Has runes for self-shrinking and self-sorting, and a full suite of security wards.

### The Gift of the Magi
A tongue-in-cheek name for Riddle's project to give muggles access to magic.

### The Deathly Hallows
#### Elder Wand
One of the three Deathly Hallows. Ownership passes by combat. Owned by Dumbledore for most of the series.

#### Invisibility Cloak
One of the three Deathly Hallows. Passed down through the Peverell, and then Potter, lines, the cloak was lent to Dumbledore by James before his death. It was returned to Elysia on Christmas 1991.

#### Resurrection Stone
One of the three Deathly Hallows. Mounted on a ring and used as a horcrux in canon; in Elysiad, it's not a horcrux.

### Blood of the Chosen One
Elysia's blood is needed to re-embody V because Lily had blood-adopted vim. The Resurrection Cask needed "bone of the father" and "blood of the mother" to create a body from scratch.

### Resurrection Cask
Used to return V to a corporeal body. Not only does it recreate a human body initially, but it subsequently augments it with all his old enhancements. And a few new ones. It's the culmination of a lifetime's research and 3 years' careful assembly.

### Anchor Amulet
Perserves a soul intact at the moment of death by anchoring it to an amulet. Precursor to the Essence Extractor.

### Essence Extractor
A modified form of the horcrux ritual in runic form, which uses the sacrifice of the caster to power a severance of the soul from the body without killing the soul. It contains a runic capacitor sequence to make up for any potential power deficit by collecting ambient magic from initialization up to to the main soul-severing sequence triggering. This can potentially be years' worth of power. As capacitors of any kind aren't exactly the most stable things, later models have a limiter as well so excess power doesn't destabilize the extractor and cause it to explode.

This is what James hit on 10/31/81, though as the explosion destroyed Voldemort's body the soul-severing segment still triggered.

An essence extractor will keep the soul from moving on, but will not give the caster a new body. The Resurrection Cask is V's solution to this.

Upon activation, the essence extractor anchors the subject's soul to itself, then portkeys itself to a specialized docking bay in Riddle Manor. It then interfaces with the Purgatory mainframe and allows the soul into Elysium.

### Le Fey Grimoire
The grimoire of the Le Fey line. It contains the most comprehensive research on blood and soul magics in existence. It's also enchanted to only be accessible to those of the Le Fey line, and if no eligible heirs exist it returns itself to the Le Fey vault. It resides there until after Elysia transitions.

### Marauders' Map
A live map of (most of) Hogwarts, created by the Marauders. It shows the location of everyone at Hogwarts in real-time, labeled with their real names. It does not show "Jr./Sr./III/etc." labels, however, nor does it show the Room of Requirement or the Chamber of Secrets.

### WULF
Wireless Unlimited Latency-Free networking protocol. Uses muggle fiber-optic networking endpoint hardware, but transfers data between magic mirrors instead of over cables. This eliminates latency and allows for instantaneous data transfer and unlimited range without the need for relays. WULF packets can thus have arbitrary size; a single packet can encapsulate an arbitrary number of another protocol's packets.

### CommUne
Communication Unit. Brain implant that allows instant communication and sense/emotion/memory sharing, as well as a firewall for legilimency. Can be integrated with other brain implants, such as memory and cognition aids. Uses WULF exclusively, though a bridge through Purgatory to muggle networks can be utilized.

### Field Access Terminal
A small, text-based dumb-terminal used exclusively to access the terminal interface to Purgatory from anywhere. It's a rectangular clamshell design roughly the size of a clutch purse, with a QWERTY keyboard on the lower half and a mirror-screen on top. It's the first use of WULF in the field.

### Purgatory
A supercomputer in the basement of Riddle Manor. It's been enchanted in several ways, among them to run off of a ley line tap instead of electricity. It houses Elysium, the virtual afterlife where V resides after the events of 10/31/1981. It was originally a Cray-1; by Elysia's first year, it's been upgraded to a Cray Y-MP 8E. In 1995, it will be replaced with a scalable, modular grid running the BSD variant WIX. Network connectivity is via T-3, as well as WULF pipelines to CommUnes.

### Horcruxes
#### Fawkes (Dumbledore)
A phoenix Dumbledore has bound to himself by virtue of a piece of his soul. When Dumbledore dies, Fawkes will perch on the head of a suitable host and immolate them in a gout of smoke and fire. When the smoke clears, Dumbledore is reborn with the host's youth and vitality.
#### The Hanging Tree (Sprout)
A hybrid of a bristlecone pine, whomping willow, venemous tentacula, and devil's snare. It snatches and hangs anyone who wanders within reach of its gnarled branches, jerking them up by their necks and hanging them in a grisly display. When Sprout dies, it drops a body from its branches into its maw, a jagged gap in its trunk, and that night at midnight Sprout claws her way back to life from between its roots, gaining the previous youth and vitality of the corpse which was consumed.
#### The Basilisk Diary (Dumbledore)
When a host pours out their soul upon its pages, it pours Dumbledore's soul back into them, eventually allowing him to regenerate with the host's youth and vitality.
Captured by V's Inner Circle but lost while escaping. Currently on a shelf in a Diagon Alley second-hand book-shop.
#### Hufflepuff's Cup (Sprout)
When a host drinks from the Cup, not only do they drink in Sprout's soul, they pour out their own to regenerate her.
Captured by V's Inner Circle; currently held within Bellatrix' vault at Gringotts.

## Terminology
### Wix
Wix, wixen, everywix
A gender-neutral slang term for "witch or wizard" which is also NB-inclusive. Relatively new, but catching on among the younger generations.

### WIX
The OS which Purgatory uses. A variant of UNIX, descended from BSD.

## Research
### [Internet in Early 1990s](https://www.computerhope.com/history/1991.htm)
The pre-WWW consumer internet was composed mostly of BBSs and walled-garden proto-ISPs like Prodigy and CompuServe. Most home connections would be used to log into corporate or university servers. Inter-network communication consisted of FTP, GOPHER, Archie, Usenet, and IRC, and was rather arduous. Common civilian uses would be chatting and sharing text files among users of a given server or newsgroup.

The WWW and Linux were both invented in 1991 but were not yet in wide use. Transmission speeds were commonly 4.8Kbps until 1992, when 9.6Kbps became common.

### The Prophecy

> The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches
> Born to those who would thrice defy him
> Born as the seventh month dies
> The Dark Lord will mark him as his equal
> And he will have power the Dark Lord knows not
> And either must die at the hand of the other
> For neither can live while the other survives
> The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...

### Events of 10/31/81
What really happened that night?

#### The official story:
James and Lily Potter were under the Fidelius in Godric's Hollow, in hiding from Voldemort's forces on advice from Albus Dumbledore. Voldemort was targeting baby Harry because of a prophecy that Snape had heard part of and passed on. Sirius Black, the secret-keeper, betrayed the Potters and led Voldemort right to them.

James tried to hold Voldemort off while Lily tried to escape with Harry, but was killed almost immediately. Lily ran to the nursery for Harry, followed by Voldemort. Asked to stand aside, Lily refused, saying "kill me instead." Voldemort obliged, and then tried to kill Harry with a Killing Curse. Because of Lily's sacrifice, it backfired, destroying Voldemort's body and wrecking the house with the backlash. Harry was left with the lightning-bolt scar.

Hagrid arrived shortly thereafter, as did Sirius Black. Sirius left Hagrid his flying motorbike, and set out to track down Pettigrew. Hagrid took Harry to #4 Privet Drive, where he was left with the Dursleys on Dumbledore's orders, because of the blood ties maintaining the protection from Lily's sacrifice.

Sirius tracked down Peter on a muggle street, where Peter shouted that Sirius had betrayed Lily and James. Sirius promptly blew up the street, killing Peter and 12 bystanders. The aurors responded, finding Sirius laughing hysterically, and dragged him off to Azkaban without a trial on Bartemius Crouch Sr.'s orders.

#### What actually happened:
Lily and Snape had begun rebuilding their friendship in 1979. By 10/31/81, they were regularly corresponding. Meanwhile, James was an Order of the Phoenix member, ostensibly fighting against the Death Eaters but primarily defending the status quo at Dumbledore's orders. Peter was in fact a member of Riddle's Inner Circle, and a Death Eater spy, having mended fences with Snape back in 1977, their last year at Hogwarts. He was the impetus for Lily and Snape's reconciliation. Lily was a noted expert on blood magic, especially wards, and had corresponded with Snape about her research. Snape and Peter were also managing to change Lily's politics, garnering her sympathies for Riddle's cause.

Dumbledore insisted that the Potters go into hiding, primarily to keep Lily's expertise from aiding Riddle, casting the Fidelius himself. As such, he knew about the secret-keeper swap.

On 10/31/81, Peter let Riddle through the Fidelius after passing correspondence between Riddle and Lily. They were to work on an experiment related to blood and soul magic, attempting to isolate the source of magic in humans. To facilitate this, Lily blood-adopted Riddle to allow access to the Le Fey grimoire. James walked in on them as they were getting into the research and, being compelled by Dumbledore, immediately attacked Riddle. In the ensuing duel, James struck one of Riddle's prototype implants (capacitor sequence on the essence extractor) and it exploded violently, killing James and Lily and destroying Riddle's body and most of the house. Harry received a lightning-bolt scar from a shard of the implant, which inadvertently linked Harry's, Lily's, and Riddle's magic due to the in-progress experiment. Riddle survived due to a prototype essence extractor. Lily survived due to having the prototype anchor amulet she and Riddle had completed a couple of months ago.

Hagrid arrived shortly after the explosion, as did Sirius Black. Hagrid gave Sirius a compulsion-laced note "explaining things" from Dumbledore. Sirius then left Hagrid his flying motorbike, and set out to track down Pettigrew. Hagrid took Harry to #4 Privet Drive, where he was left with the Dursleys on Dumbledore's orders, ostensibly because of the blood ties maintaining the protection from Lily's sacrifice but really to prime the child for easier exploitation on Dumbledore's part.

Sirius tracked down Peter on a muggle street, where Peter shouted something witnesses interpreted as accusing Sirius of betrayed Lily and James, and cast a blasting hex behind him as a distraction while cutting off a finger and escaping in rat form. He intended only a loud noise, but inadvertently hit a gas leak, which blew up the street, killing 12 bystanders. The aurors responded, finding Sirius laughing hysterically, and dragged him off to Azkaban without a trial on Bartemius Crouch Sr.'s orders.
