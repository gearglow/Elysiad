# The trans!Harry / trans-human!Voldemort cyberpunk/magitech AU fic - notes


## Worldbuilding:

* Wixen UK is conservative and reactionary
  * Most wixen don't have an ounce of common sense
* Most magic requires a degree of whimsy.
  * The so-called Dark Arts... don't.
* Death Eaters are revolutionary trans-humanist post-scarcity anarchist group
  * Only faction with magitech
* Cortical stacks and nano-tech are post-revival technologies
  * Protoypes exist prior, but are very buggy
  * Cortical stacks have portkeys embedded to remove them from danger upon catastrophic shell damage
  * Buggy tech is responsible for several of V and co's high-profile "atrocities"
    * Prototype cortical stack responsible for V's "wraith" (ghost-in-the-machine?) inhabiting Quirrell and causing stutters; during Stone confrontation, implanted storage matrix overloads, killing Quirrell and destroying his own prototype cortical stack before the portkey can activate. It activates after, porting out the remains of the implants. V's "wraith" has a failsafe "physical" wraith form and escapes the matrix before it's completely destroyed.
    * Pettigrew didn't intend to kill 12 muggles; he accidentally hit a gas line when trying to create a diversion.
    * Riddle's Diary was actually a memory, a corrupted alpha prototype cortical stack/backup. 
    * Dumbledore interfered the night the Potters died; V was meeting with Lily re: <???> on Snape's advice.

## Characters:

### Voldemort

* Not evil, just revolutionary
* Came from poverty, saw the potential post-scarcity of magic
* Doesn't actually believe in blood purity, but found it a useful point of leverage to recruit fighters early on. It's since backfired several times.
* Souls/holography/state-saves/horcruxes
  * Studied horcruxes because that's all the magical world had on working with souls. Knowledge used for development of cortical stacks, but *they're not the same thing.*
* Bletchley Park during the war? Cold-war involvement?
  * Muggles develop theory of Information Processing; no real magical equivalent

### Harry Potter

* Transgender girl
  * Closeted until defection
  * Abused for it by Dursleys
* Defects from the Order
* Transitions upon defection with help from V's magitech
  * Transition fulfils prophecy - "Harry" becomes deadname and thus "doesn't survive."
* Potential Rebirth names:
  * Andraste
  * Artemis
  * Athena
  * **Atropos**
  * Aurora
  * Bellona
  * ***Elysia***
  * **Eris**
  * **Hel**
  * Iris
  * Lilith
  * Maya
  * Morana
  * **Nemesis**
  * Nyx
  * Tanith
  * Victoria

### Hermione Granger

* Buys into Ministry/Order propaganda until after Harry's defection
  * It's the house-elves that convince her
* Goes by Tanith at some point?

### Severus Snape

* Was on V's side but defected to the Order after Lily died; he thought it was V's fault.
* Open allegiance returns to V after Harry's defection
