# Elysiad - Characters
## Alastor Moody
Pureblood. Cishet male. He/him/his.
Mad-Eye is to grizzled what grizzled is to ordinary people. Paranoid to a fault, his mantra of 'constant vigilance' has served him well through his many years as an auror. Despite this, he is heavily scarred, missing a leg and an eye, and trusts no-one. His missing leg has been replaced with a crude wooden prosthetic, but his missing eye has been replaced by a magical one which can move independently of his remaining natural eye, and see through solid objects and most magical concealment. Moody may not be half the man he used to be, but he is still a force to be reckoned with.
Mad-Eye is an old and trusted friend of Albus Dumbledore, and all of the dark deeds that entails.

## Albus Dumbledore
Pureblood. Repressed homosexual. Cisgender man. He/Him/His.
A manipulative bastard masquerading as a grandfatherly, twinkle-eyed old codger. Favors ridiculous outfits and convoluted plots. Obsessed with what he sees as "the greater good." In his case, it involves sacrificing others without their consent, maintaining the conservative status quo, and manipulating others for his own ends. The fact that, along with being headmaster of Hogwarts, he is also Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, and head of the Order of the Phoenix, not to mention master of the Elder Wand, should be cause for far more concern than it is. What is most concerning, though, is that he has also created multiple horcruxes, one of which is his phoenix familiar, Fawkes. Another is a diary which he used to frame Tom Riddle for the original Chamber of Secrets incident in vis 6th year.
